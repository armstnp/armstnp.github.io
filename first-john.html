<h4 id="orgbd5f409">B. A Biographical Sketch of John the Apostle</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgbd5f409">
<p>
Jesus chose James and John as two of His first disciples. Sons of Zebedee, they ran a large
fishing business, and had good social standing in Capernaum and were well-known and respected
in Jerusalem, and even by the high priest's house. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 18:15" target="_blank">John 18:15</a>
</p>

<p>
Eventually the two took over the family business, forming a partnership with Simon Peter.
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Luke 5:10" target="_blank">Luke 5:10</a>
</p>

<p>
Their mother, Salome, supported Jesus and the apostles. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Luke 8:3" target="_blank">Luke 8:3</a>
She was a woman of fervor and intensity, seen in part by her request to Jesus to allow her sons
to rule alongside Christ in His kingdom at His left and right hand.
She was also the sister of Jesus' mother mary, making James and John Jesus' first cousins.
</p>

<p>
Jesus nicknamed James and John 'boanerges', 'Sons of Thunder', which reflects their temperament
as seen in the Gospel records.
</p>

<p>
Peter, James, and John became the inner circle of the apostles. James is always mentioned first
in the NT, meaning he's probably the older, and was the first of the two to die.
</p>

<p>
John's name came from Hebrew 'Johanan' - 'God graciously gave'. He was first a disciple of John
the Baptist first, then to Jesus. He was with Peter regularly throughout the Gospel accounts,
and he was known as 'the disciple whom Jesus loved.' He was the only disciple with the women at
the cross, and Jesus charged him with caring for His mother. He saw the resurrection, and was
the first to believe in its reality. He was at the upper room at Pentecost 40 days later, and
continued alongside Peter in the opening chapters of Acts. He became one of the pillars of the
church in Jerusalem, and was one of those who vetted Paul as an apostle. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Galatians 2:9" target="_blank">Galatians 2:9</a>
</p>

<p>
After the historical record concludes at the end of Acts, we have some evidence of what
happened to John next from 2nd century sources: He left Israel shortly before 67 AD, when Paul
was martyred in Rome, and three years before the Romans destroyed Jerusalem. He spent the next
30 years ministering in Asia Minor - modern-day Turkey - where Paul had planted so many
churches. He eventually settled to lead in Ephesus, where Paul had spent three years,
continuing the work Paul had begun, writing extensively.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, under the reign of Domitian, he was exiled to the isle of Patmos to work in the
salt mines, and there he wrote the book of Revelation. He was later released, returned to
Ephesus, and lived out his last days, died, and was buried there, the last apostle to die at
the end of the first century. He was the only apostle to die a natural death. John's thunder
was put towards the kingdom of Christ, newly tempered by love.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org166e7d1">
<p>
When John wrote 1 John, he was much older than his readers. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:1,18,28" target="_blank">2:1,18,28</a>
</p>

<p>
He doesn't refer to the persecution under Domitian which started in 95 AD, so that likely puts
an upper bound on the year.
</p>

<p>
The false teaching John confronts arose in the last third of the first century, putting a lower
bound on the year.

<p>
The churches Christ wrote to in the beginning of Revelation, and the smaller churches in the
cities and villages surrounding those major cities.

<p>
The epistle has no specific audience, meaning it was meant to be circulated among the churches
along the postal route of Asia Minor, much as Revelation was..

<h3 id="org342720c">III. The Occasion of 1 John: Defection of False Teachers and their Followers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org342720c">
<p>
Paul had predicted that false teachers would arise within the Ephesian church, since it was the
most important city in that region, and was the intellectual center. This made it a ripe target
for false teaching to enter in.
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:18-19" target="_blank">2:18-19</a> John warns of the future Antichrist, but also of the present echoes of what is to come,
those who reflect the character of that great evil ruler and his lies. In this passage, he makes
clear that these false teachers ('antichrists') were a part of these churches, gathering
followers, and eventually leaving the churches when those who stood for the truth held their
ground. In leaving, they pulled away their followers with them and set out to gather more. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 4:1" target="_blank">4:1</a>
</p>

<p>
These false teachers left those churches, but continued to convince loyal followers of Christ to
follow their bad example, bad theology, and immoral lifestyles. This mass exit of people from
the church would have shaken the confidence of faithful teachers. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:26" target="_blank">2:26</a>

<h4 id="org3f3b582">Who are the False Teachers in 1 John?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4 blank-section" id="text-org3f3b582">
</div>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="org6c7c81b"></a>1. Pre-Gnosticism?<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org6c7c81b">
<p>
Not full-blown, but proto-version, coming after the Judaizers seen in e.g. Galatians. This was
the most dangerous heresy to threaten the church during the first three centuries. It didn't
reach its mature form until the second century, but it already existed in 'embryonic form'
during the first century, as cited by Irenaeus, who said it was started by a man named Simon
the Magician: the same seen in <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Acts 8" target="_blank">Acts 8</a>. This should be taken with a grain of salt, but it is at
least clear that it had its start before the 2nd century.
</p>

<p>
This combined paganism syncretically - first with Judaism, and then with Christianity.
</p>
</div>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="orgb438971"></a>Matter is inherently evil, and spirit is good.<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgb438971">
<p>
False teachers were willing to affirm some degree of Jesus' deity, but they denied His
humanity, since a fleshly body would taint Him with evil. This leads to the heresy of
Docetism, from the Greek 'to seem' or 'to appear', claiming He only appeared to have a real
body.
</p>

<p>
Followers of this would sometimes treat their bodies harshly, a form of asceticism.
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Colossians 2" target="_blank">Colossians 2</a>
</p>

not the 'pure soul'.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org2a795c2">
<p>
This is not the Christian Gospel, not the Christian faith; there's mixing here of paganism

</ul>
</li>
<li><a id="org8bac59e"></a>2. Cerinthianism?<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org8bac59e">
<p>
Named after Cerinthus, a Jewish false teacher who lived in Ephesus at the time John was there.
Irenaeus claims he taught the same false moral doctrine as the Nicolaitans, seen in
the letters of Revelation.
</p>

<p>
Polycarp tells a story of John going to the bathhouse, only to be told Cerinthus was already
in there; John was reported to have fled without taking a bath, making clear that he believed
God's judgment rested upon the man for distorting the Gospel, and that he would put himself at
risk by even being under the same roof.

<p>
It's an epistle: even lacking many of the formalities of a 1st century letter, it says 'I
write&#x2026;' repeatedly, and the early church fathers all referred to it as such.
</p>

<p>
The shaken believers in the churches needed protection and reassurance, and John writes to give
them those things, and to establish them more firmly in their faith by highlighting the
differences between genuine and false believers.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9c2a2c9">
<p>
The world is full of satanic deception about the Christian faith, and John tries to protect his

highlights the source of these lies as demonic.

<p>
This is not a polemic against the false teachers, and nor is he focused on contradicting error;
instead, he focuses on reinforcing the understanding of the fundamentals of the faith.

John's structure is notoriously difficult to grasp, given the simplicity of its contents. Two
mental images are that of a symphony, in which themes are woven together throughout various
movements; and that of a spiral staircase, where the three tests presented as marks of a believer
are reiterated.

<p>
John introduces several crucial facts about this person who is the center of their proclamation.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org751bea9" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org751bea9">A. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 1:1a" target="_blank">1a</a> He Existed Eternally.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org751bea9">
<p>
'beginning' seems to indicate eternity past, given his use of the same phrase in <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:13-14" target="_blank">2:13-14</a>.
</p>

<p>
There is also great similarity to the beginning of His Gospel. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 1:1" target="_blank">John 1:1</a> That in turn echoes the
beginning of the whole Scripture, and of world history. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Genesis 1:1" target="_blank">Genesis 1:1</a>
</p>

<p>
John 1:1 could be translated: 'In the beginning, the Word already was [continually]'.
</p>

<p>
God's eternality is regularly in view in Scripture: He existed before creation. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Micah 5:2" target="_blank">Micah 5:2</a>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 17:5" target="_blank">John 17:5</a>
</p>

<p>
This confronts the Cerenthian heresy head-on: Jesus existed before the incarnation and even the
creation itself.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org20b12dc" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org20b12dc">B. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 1:1b" target="_blank">1b</a> He was Truly Human.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org20b12dc">
<p>
This attacks pre-gnosticism head-on, by refusing Docetism: that Jesus only <i>seemed</i> or
<i>appeared</i> to have a real body. Instead, John retorts firmly that he was quite physically real.
He gives the physical testimony of all the apostles, showing that with all their senses they
had confirmed Christ's physical reality and His human nature.
</p>

<p>
This was no spiritual shared vision or hallucination. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Luke 24:39" target="_blank">Luke 24:39</a>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0ff0340">
<p>
'concerning the Word of Life' - the prior two clauses concern the Word of Life.
</p>

<p>
'Word of Life' refers most likely to Jesus Himself. John uses 'concerning' to describe persons
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 5:9-10" target="_blank">cf. 5:9-10</a>; the first clauses regard a person; the following verse continues on to describe it
as a person; and John uses 'The Word' - Greek 'logos' - to refer to Christ.
</p>

<p>
'Logos' represented reason and rationality in Greek philosophy; but John drew his use of it
from Hebrew Scripture, referring to the Word of God as His self-expression in creation
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Genesis 1:3" target="_blank">Genesis 1:3</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Psalm 33:6" target="_blank">Psalm 33:6</a>, and His self-expression in revelation <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Isaiah 38:4" target="_blank">Isaiah 38:4</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 1:18" target="_blank">John 1:18</a>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb3ed4ea">
<p>
Verse 2 is a parentheses in the prologue, but it drives home the central theme of his Gospel:
the Word was <i>manifested</i>.
</p>

<p>
'manifest' captures all of Jesus' life on Earth, the entire historical event of His
incarnation. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 1:14" target="_blank">John 1:14</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 Timothy 3:16" target="_blank">1 Timothy 3:16</a>

'which' - this Greek preposition can be interpreted,

</p>

<p>
He is in person distinct from the Father; yet He enjoys an eternal relationship with God. He
enjoyed a past continual existence with God. 'with' here means 'to' or 'toward', having a
connotation of 'face-to-face with', i.e. an intimate relationship. Again, this echoes the
beginning of John's Gospel.

them to supply that crucial evidence after He had been raised.

'testify' - can refer to someone who steps forward as a witness, but also to someone who is
chosen as a witness. Jesus chose the apostles as His hand-picked eyewitnesses. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 1:7" target="_blank">John 1:7</a>

<p>
Some read the testimony of the apostles and say, "I can't believe this is true;" yet we would
not make a similar claim to any other event that occurred in history! We only know of
historical events by eyewitness testimony; we only know of <i>current</i> events by eyewitness
testimony! That which we have not seen, we only know by others' testimonies. Your confidence
in those things is a factor of confidence in the eyewitnesses. You can't say you don't believe
it because you didn't see it, but rather only that you don't trust Jesus or those he picked to
be His witnesses.

<p>
The word 'apostolos', from which we get 'apostle', was one chosen to be a legal representative.

They are authorized to act legally on behalf of another, much like delegating the power of

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc02f4b2">
<p>
'so that' - purpose statement
</p>

<p>
Fellowship is <i>not</i> a mystical experience (emotional, sentimental feeling of 'God's presence');
since the nature of our fellowship with God is the same as our fellowship with other believers.
And all believers have fellowship with God, regardless of how they <i>feel</i>.
</p>

<p>
This bad view of fellowship in modern times extends from the 'higher and deeper life' movement,
which in part focused on 'feeling and experiencing God's presence'. These ideas are spiritually
destructive.
</p>

<p>
Fellowship is not something subjective you feel, but something objective.
</p>

<p>
Fellowship - Grk. 'koinonia' - meaning common, referring to things held in common, such as co-
ownership of a business or joint possessions of a married couple. See e.g. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Luke 5:10" target="_blank">Luke 5:10</a>. This
implies a close, shared relationship, and used here it refers to such a relationship entered
into at salvation.
</p>

<p>
At salvation, every believer becomes a child of God <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 3:1,10" target="_blank">3:1,10</a>, and as children of God together, we
have thus become brethren <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 3:14; 5:1" target="_blank">3:14; 5:1</a> and have a close, loving relationship with these other
children of God. Fellowship, then, is to have and to act on these new relationships.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgc46f2b2">
<p>
Holding a common <i>faith</i> and a common interpersonal relationship with one another; when we
believe the message of the apostles, we enter the same relationship with all other believers
that the apostles shared with one another. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:19" target="_blank">1 John 2:19</a>

<p>
A genuine believer cannot remain unattached to a local church, a body of genuine believers; to
do so is to sin against Christ, to ignore and to hate your brethren with whom you ought to
have a bond of fellowship.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org02b12e3">
<p>
'we <span class="underline">have</span> fellowship' - in Greek, this tense states that he is writing to those who
certainly have it, not that <i>might</i> have it.
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:3,5,12-14,23,27,29; 3:1,15,24; 4:7,12,13,15,16; 5:1,11,13,19,20" target="_blank">2:3,5,12-14,23,27,29; 3:1,15,24; 4:7,12,13,15,16; 5:1,11,13,19,20</a>
</p>

<p>
This is the case for every believer. Fellowship is based on a fact, not on a feeling. You are
never going to have consistent fellowship if you're searching for the right feeling, and
expecting those feelings to remain constant; instead, we are enjoying the assurance of an
objetive relationship we already have.
</p>
</div>

<li><a id="org3d466fa"></a>b. We need to <span class="underline">grow</span> in the depth of our relationship.<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org3d466fa">
<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:12-14" target="_blank">2:12-14</a> shows stages of spiritual maturity, and the corresponding depth of relationship with
the Father and the Son. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Colossians 1:10" target="_blank">Colossians 1:10</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=2 Peter 3:18" target="_blank">2 Peter 3:18</a>
</p>

<p>
This is not mystical and emotional, but rather based on faith in the Word of God. Feeling is
not the <i>engine</i> of the Christian life, but the caboose; it follows the <i>knowledge</i> you have
of God. You cannot grow without knowledge.
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Exodus 33:13-14" target="_blank">Exodus 33:13-14</a> This is the second of Moses' three requests in this passage, asked 'since You
have shown me grace'. God's 'ways' refer to the ruts of a cart path or walking path, as a
metaphor for patterns of behaviour. God is not capricious in His behaviour, but is
consistent, His actions able to be traced and followed (though certainly not fully). We grow
in our relationship with Him by hearing His Word and seeing His works; we see His actions and
thus come to know God.
</p>

<p>
This is not mystical, ethereal communion founded on feelings, but based on concrete,
objective actions. Consider the relationship of a parent with their child; learning
progressively more and more about the character of the father as they grow, knowing them more
personally as time and maturity progress.
</p>

<p>
Emotional fumes will not sustain you. Only a genuine knowledge founded on an existing
fellowship with God will.

There is not even a fleck of darkness and moral evil - sin - to be found in Him at all. While
the physical light we experience is always in degrees and shades, this statement further
emphasizes God's holiness: it is not merely of the highest degree, but is so wholly separate
that it has no shadow or shade. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Habakkuk 1:13" target="_blank">Habakkuk 1:13</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=James 1:13" target="_blank">James 1:13</a>

<p>
The Greek and other Gentile peoples thought of the gods as the Greek pantheon - evil,
vindictive, petty, cruel, selfish, greedy, capricious, etc. But John makes clear that the
character of God is perfect moral light; and thus, we must not live in sin ourselves.

'False Christians' - People who claim and profess to know Christ, but in fact have no

One who says they are a Christian, but live in a pattern of unbroken, unrepentant sin are not

<p>
This claim may have risen from pre-gnosticism, claiming the body is inherently evil and so sin
was excused as being inevitable. But even a vast number of American churches now hold this
view without the undergirding of pre-gnosticism.
</p>

<p>
A verbal profession of faith - praying a prayer, walking an aisle, throwing a stick in the
fire at camp - is no guarantee of genuine saving faith! Those who work lawlessness as their
way of life - those who disobey more than obey as a continuing pattern - should not trust in
their profession as genuine. No amount of knowledge or profession of Christ's name can save in
and of itself.

'the blood of Jesus His Son' - the sacrificial death required as an atonement for sin.

If the pattern of our lives is holiness, even if we do sin, Christ's blood will continue to
cleanse us from <i>all</i> sin. A genuine Christian will have all their sin wholly dealt with.

Ask yourself: what is the pattern of your life? Do you habitually live in sin, those things

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org4b0c12b">
<p>
'If we are saying' - consistently claiming this, ongoing; the next couplet talk about actions
of sin, but this one refers to a denial of sin <i>nature</i>: original sin, or total depravity.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Original sin</dt><dd>the effects of the sin of Adam on every person, consisting of the guilt of
sin, and corruption in your nature from conception.</dd>
<dt>Total depravity</dt><dd>The comprehensive corruption of every part of our being: body, mind, and
soul.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The pre-gnostics were arguing as dualists: the body is evil, so you can do whatever you want
with it. The spirit is inherently perfect, free of sin.
</p>

<p>
The modern expression of denial of sin takes different forms:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"I am basically a good person who sometimes makes bad choices." - Liberal protestantism
holds this, as does the average man on the street.</li>
<li>"I'm bad at times, but not totally bad; there's a part of me that's good."</li>
<li>"I'm not a good person, but I do some good things."</li>
<li>"I make bad choices, but it's not my fault; someone else caused me to do it, or my culture
influenced me, or it's genetic, or it's the internet, etc." - Denying guilt for sinful
choices by blame-shifting; unbelievers always refuse to take <i>full</i> responsibility for their
sin.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Most people will admit to sometimes committing acts of sin; but most will <i>not</i> admit that
they are totally depraved in all parts of their being, terminally infected by it, with nothing
spiritually good in them at all.
</p>

<p>
All of these are self-deception: leading oneself astray. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 1-2" target="_blank">Romans 1-2</a> show us that men <i>know</i>
what God's law, as God has written it on their heart, so they have no excuse not to know the
extent of their sin.
</p>

<p>
'The truth is not in us' - those who believe this always come up with a works-based Gospel, in
which they contribute some part. They do not have the truth of the Gospel and Scripture in
them. You cannot be saved until you acknowledge your spiritual bankruptcy.

<div class="outline-text-9" id="text-org24cf421">

Our sins were all pardoned when we were saved, aren't we? It happened in the past with
ongoing, continuing results, according to the Greek in <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Colossians 2:13" target="_blank">Colossians 2:13</a>.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Another metaphor is that of a courtroom: before salvation, you were in a courtroom, and God
was your judge; after salvation, the Judge has pardoned you before the law, and adopted you
into His household. The legal standing is perfectly righteous, and we will never stand
before the court again. But even in the Judge's home, we still sin, and that sin needs to
dealt with that we may be relationally reconciled to our Father.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="orgd86323f"></a>c. It's a constant practice.<br />
<div class="outline-text-9" id="text-orgd86323f">
<p>
It must be the unbroken pattern of our lives. 'We are confessing' - ongoing, consistent,
constant. We are to pray continually, and repentance is part of our prayer. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Matthew 6:9-12" target="_blank">Matthew 6:9-12</a>

<li><a id="org55a5020"></a>d. It's directed primarily to God.<br />
<div class="outline-text-9" id="text-org55a5020">
<p>
Confession to God is clearly implied, since He is the one forgiving those sins in the
latter half of the verse; additionally, all sin is against God. We aren't even told to
confess sin to any man for forgiveness of sins from God.
</p>

<p>
We <i>are</i> still to confess our sins to other believers, though, since we have also sinned
against them; even if the sin is primarily against God, the sin against your brother is
still real. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Matthew 5:23-24" target="_blank">Matthew 5:23-24</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Luke 17:4" target="_blank">Luke 17:4</a>

'Our sins' - particular, individual acts; as well as categories. We can't know all our
sins, but we make every effort. Patterns of confession can be found in <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Nehemiah 9" target="_blank">Nehemiah 9</a>

<div class="outline-text-9" id="text-org628b15f">
<p>
'faithful' - dependable, trustworthy; God acts consistent with His character, and keeps His
promises. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Exodus 34:6-7" target="_blank">Exodus 34:6-7</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Psalm 86:5" target="_blank">Psalm 86:5</a> God is, by nature, a forgiving God; and He is dependable
to act according to His nature.
</p>

<p>
He also promised forgiveness and salvation, and He will uphold that promise. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Hebrews 10:17" target="_blank">Hebrews 10:17</a>
</p>

<p>
The basis for this forgiveness? 'righteous' - it is just, in keeping with the law, for God
to forgive sin! How can this be? Only when there is payment for the sin. God is not a
sentimental forgiver: He can only forgive if He preserves His just nature. He cannot
override one attribute of His character with another. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Hebrews 9:22" target="_blank">Hebrews 9:22</a>
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:2" target="_blank">1 John 2:2</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 3:25-26" target="_blank">Romans 3:25-26</a> Christ satisfied the cost of our sins, allowing God to be both
forgiving and just: all parts of His character satisfied and working together to work our
salvation and His glory.
</p>

<p>
When we come to God seeking forgiveness, we are appealing to His nature as a forgiving God
who has promised His forgiveness, and appealing to the sacrifice of Christ as satisfying
the justice of God.
</p>

<p>
'forgive' - lit. 'be forgiving', 'sending away', 'letting go of a debt by not demanding
it'. It is a debt God wipes away.
</p>

<p>
'cleanse' - sin is a stain on the soul that needs to be washed; another image for what sin
and forgiveness are. The blood of Jesus is what cleanses us, not our confession.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org474effb">
<p>
Tense of the verb - "at no point in the past, continuing on to the present, have I ever
sinned."
</p>

<p>
How does anyone come to deny such an obvious truth?
</p>

<p>
Firstly, John is addressing pre-gnostic dualism: 'Matter is evil and spirit is good, so
whatever I do with my body isn't really sin. I'm not morally culpable for it, and it doesn't
affect my relationship with God.' This is not common today.
</p>

<p>
Other ways people do this today:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Denying God's existence, and therefore the reality of a moral standard. Sin is then based on
'whatever hurts another person' or 'whatever the cultural consensus is'; or even denied
entirely.</li>
<li>Reclassifying sinful behaviour as a physiological problem. Drunkenness or sexual sin is
classified as solely physical conditions, for example.</li>
<li>Reclassifying sinful behaviour as a psychological problem: mental illness.</li>
<li>Shifting the blame and guilt for your sin to other people. "It's because of what &lt;X&gt; did to
me / my environment / my circumstances."</li>
<li>Exchanging newly defined 'cultural sins' for biblical sins. Two current examples are 'failing
to recycle' and 'failing to accept those who are transgender'. This enables those who do
this to feel morally good while having lives filled with actual sin.</li>
<li>Affirming as morally good what the Bible calls sin; calling pride and lust things to be
desired and rewarded.</li>
<li>Downplaying or minimizing sins by renaming and justifying them. Drunkenness becomes
alcoholism, adultery becomes 'having an affair', selfishness becomes 'I deserve&#x2026;', etc.,
perhaps labeled 'weaknesses' or 'struggles' but never considering them as they are:
deadly violations of the law of Holy God.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These tend to think of Jesus as a good moralist. But this is not what He was. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Luke 5:30-31" target="_blank">Luke 5:30-31</a>
</p>

<p>
'If we say that we have not sinned, <i>we make Him [God] a liar.</i>'
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 Kings 8:46" target="_blank">1 Kings 8:46</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Proverbs 20:9" target="_blank">Proverbs 20:9</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Ecclesiastes 9:3" target="_blank">Ecclesiastes 9:3</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Isaiah 53:6; 64:6" target="_blank">Isaiah 53:6; 64:6</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 3:10-12,23" target="_blank">Romans 3:10-12,23</a>
</p>

<p>
What about after we come to Christ? We still have sin in us! <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Psalm 130:3; 143:2" target="_blank">Psalm 130:3; 143:2</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 7:18-19" target="_blank">Romans 7:18-19</a>
</p>

<p>
By denying and downplaying our sins, we are calling God a liar by nature to His face, when His
Word is so blatantly clear on the matter. If you do so, you are not a Christian, by
definition.

<p>
A true Christian has the same desires for himself as John had for the Christians to whom he
wrote: that they may not sin.
</p>

<p>
Just because we confess we have sin does not mean we take our sin lightly. Even as sin
continues to reside in our flesh, we do not desire to commit sin, and we wage war against it
in the pursuit of holiness.
</p>

<p>
'that you may not sin' - the Greek reads 'that you may not commit <i>even one</i> act of sin'
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 5:20-6:2" target="_blank">Romans 5:20-6:2</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 Peter 1:14-16" target="_blank">1 Peter 1:14-16</a>
Your inner being has been changed, made a new creation in Christ, one which no longer desires
sin.
</p>

<p>
So we cannot deny that we have sin, but we desire not to sin; we don't just give up or dive
deeper into sin. You know sin is there and you <i>hate it</i>. This isn't mere remorse or
selective desire to kill one inconvenient sin, but rather a desire to be totally free of sin,
like Christ in every way.

'And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous;' -
Satan deceives to sin by minimizing before, and recriminating you after, claiming that the
sin is so great that you stand condemned before God and that God would never forgive such a
sin.
</p>

<p>
'And' is better interpreted here 'But' - All believers will sin, so how do we deal with that
sin? Even when we do, Christ ontercedes for us.
</p>

<p>
lit. 'we are having an <b>Advocate</b>' - Grk. 'parakletos', translated 'Helper' in John's Gospel
and refer to the Holy Spirit in those cases. Lit. 'to call to one's side', an advocate who
pleads the cause of another. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 14:16" target="_blank">John 14:16</a> implies this, showing that both Christ and the
Spirit are our advocates. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 8:26,34" target="_blank">Romans 8:26,34</a> The word has legal connotations, but it would be
too much to call Jesus our 'defense attorney'; rather, it refers more to a friend that
testifies on one's behalf, especially as we do not have an adversarial relationship to the
Father.
</p>

<p>
Instead, the role of the High Priest is suitable: one who is advocating on behalf of his
people. His continuing role in Heaven is now to advocate continually for His people before
His Father, continually <i>applying</i> His finished work on the cross to His people as they sin.

<li>The anger of pagan gods was sinful, petty, and capricious.</li>
<li>The wrath of the pagan gods was a sinful uncontrollable outburst, like our own.
God's is a settled, holy disposition against sin; not hot or quick-tempered.</li>
<li>In pagan religions, the worshipper had to satisfy the offended deity.</li>

<li><a id="org3739864"></a>ii.  It was pictured in the OT sacrifices.<br />
<div class="outline-text-10" id="text-org3739864">
<p>
Leviticus 1-16 describe the reality that us sinful people can only approach God through
sacrifice, the death of the living. There were five different sacrifices for individual
worship, not to mention the national sacrifices made.
</p>

<p>
In example, the Sin Offering in the Old Testament:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You would have brought a physically perfect animal to the Temple.</li>
<li>You would have laid your hands on the offering, with the implication that it was now
your representative.</li>
<li>You would have slaughtered it with your own hand.</li>
<li>As the blood poured out of the animal, the priest would have caught the blood in a bowl
and splattered it against the altar.</li>
<li>Then, he would have taken the specified part of the animal and laid it on the altar to
burn.</li>
</ol>

<p>
What is communicated through this is that the innocent animal was dying on your behalf,
your guilt transferred to it. It is but a picture of what God Himself would one day
provide as the perfect atonement. The sacrifices were for God, not for the worshipper,
indicated by the repeated phrase first seen in <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Genesis 8:20-21" target="_blank">Genesis 8:20-21</a>: 'a soothing aroma to the
Lord', referring to the burnt flesh of the sacrifice!
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Leviticus 1:9,13,17; 2:2,9; 4:31" target="_blank">Leviticus 1:9,13,17; 2:2,9; 4:31</a> and so on. This death calms God's just wrath against sin.
This is a worrying reality, telling us about the depth and evil of our sin, that it would
provoke such wrath!
</p>

<p>
Sacrifice was not merely to reform men somehow, or to point them inward; but rather to
point to the reality of God's justice and His demand of death as payment for sin.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="orgf74c7ab"></a>iii. It was <span class="underline">never</span> truly accomplished in OT sacrifices.<br />

</p>

<p>
These sacrifices merely pictured and pointed towards the reality, but they could not do it
themselves.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org47ccdad"></a>iv.  It could only be accomplished by the voluntary death of a perfectly holy, sinless human.<br />

</p>

<p>
Normally, the high priest <i>offers</i> the sacrifice, but Christ is both high priest <i>and</i>
sacrifice!
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Hebrews 9" target="_blank">Hebrews 9</a> describes in detail what occurred: the perfection of all that had been pointed
to imperfectly by the Temple! The Mercy Seat covers God's view of His broken law. Unlike
the priests, Christ went into the sanctuary once through the sacrifice of His own blood.
No further sacrifice will ever be needed!
</p>

<p>
Christ had to die as propitiation to vindicate God's justice. In part, Christ's death
allows God to let all sinners live a day beyond their sin - He can patiently defer
judgment. But its primary purpose was to satisfy wholly God's wrath against the sin of His
own, enduring that wrath on our behalf.

<b>Somebody</b> will drink the cup of God's wrath that you have deserved and earned. Either you
will drink it yourself, eternally punished by God; or you will accept God's amazing offer
of His Son, who drank the cup on your behalf.
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Luke 18:13-14" target="_blank">Luke 18:13-14</a> show what this acceptance looks like: humbly acknowledging your sin, crying
out to God, seeking to have God's wrath against his sin be satisfied in the sacrifice he
was offering. He asks God to apply this propitiation to him. Likewise, we must humbly ask
God to apply Christ's propitiatory death to us, repenting of our sin and seeking Christ's
blood to pay for it.
</p>

<p>
We must confess our sins, trust Christ's intercession for us with the Father, and trust in
Christ's death as the grounds for our justification: believing that the great exchange has
occurred, us being treated as Christ ought to have been, and Christ being treated as we
ought to have been.

It stands in union with all of God's other attributes, inseparable from them. This love is

This is not selfish; it is self-giving and self-sacrificing. The Father gave to the Son the
gift of redeemed humanity; the Son gave His obedience to the Father of love; God's love for
His creatures is freely given, unobligated. While God has a special love of His people, He

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org7a5761a">
<p>
'true' - real, genuine, in contrast to fake. Love was revealed in Christ in a way we had never
understood it before.
</p>

<p>
His life and death powerfully demonstrated it, by perfectly obeying God's commandments to
love. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Mark 10:21" target="_blank">Mark 10:21</a> He loved unbelievers, loved His enemies. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 13:1" target="_blank">John 13:1</a> He loved His own to its
end ('telos'), its maximal fulfillment. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 5:8" target="_blank">Romans 5:8</a> He redeemed us while we were still sinners,
in total, hopeless rebellion to Him. The cross is the greatest vision of God's love we have
been given.
</p>

<p>
Jesus clearly explained and reemphasized love in His teaching. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 13:34-35; 15:12,17" target="_blank">John 13:34-35; 15:12,17</a>
</p>

<p>
Jesus completely raised the standard of love. We are to love Him just as He has loved us; this
is not a minimal interpretation of the command to love, but a maximal one. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Luke 10:30-37" target="_blank">Luke 10:30-37</a>

<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 8:12; 11:9-10; 12:35,46" target="_blank">John 8:12; 11:9-10; 12:35,46</a> Christ spoke of Himself as light. To be in the light is to claim
fellowship and identity with Jesus.
</p>

<p>
The false teachers - pre-gnostics - claimed 'we have been enlightened, being special
recipients of superior knowledge'. Yet their fruit shows anything but.
</p>

<p>
'brother' - always referring to fellow Christians in this book, and commonly refers to such
throughout the NT.
</p>

<p>
'hates his brother' - hates those with whom a genuine Christian should naturally have a close
and loving bond. Why this and not 'loving everybody?' because hatred for believers is the
clearest mark possible that someone is not themselves believer. If we can't love those to
whom we say we are related, adopted into the same family, then we can't possibly love others
to whom we aren't supposedly related.
</p>

<p>
Grk. is 'is hating' - a continual pattern of hatred. The false teachers John is confronting
treated believers as contemptible and ignorant.
</p>

<p>
What does this hatred look like? John goes on to make a stark contrast: light and darkness,
walking and stumbling, love and hatred. You only do one or the other; there is no neutral
position. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 11:23" target="_blank">John 11:23</a> Hating is not just extreme hatred, bitterness, and malice; it is
everything that falls short of true, biblical love. This ranges from treating others
selfishly or indifferently, to bitter hatred.
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Titus 3:1-3" target="_blank">Titus 3:1-3</a> Every unbeliever acts in these ways. The biblical standard of hatred is always
that it is anything short of love. Even the love of unbelievers is a selfish, self-centered
kind of love. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Matthew 5:46-48" target="_blank">Matthew 5:46-48</a>
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 3:9-18" target="_blank">Romans 3:9-18</a> Toxic speech; deceitful outward kindness; deadly and bitter words that reveal
the content of the heart that produces them; a predisposition to violent anger; leaving chaos
and broken relationships in their wake; not even having any perception of the path that would
lead them to peace with men, much less with God. God - by His common grace - restrains the
full extent of evil that most men express, but this is still the depth of death in the heart
of every man.
</p>

<p>
So, given this contrast, the love of believers is distinct, visibly contrasting to their
former lives and the lives of the unbelievers around them, and is a clear indication that
they have been saved.

applying any control; and it is only observed by its effects. The fruits of the Spirit are
those things that He alone can produce in the heart of a believer.

When an unbeliever 'loves', it's still all about themselves; their focus is on what they can
obtain from the relationship.

Are there two or three groups listed here, with 'little children' and 'young men' constituting

</p>

<p>
There is some case to be made for two groups, but it is still the weaker argument:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>This doesn't change John's normal use of the phrase 'little children' elsewhere, where it
refers to every Christian. Every believer has been a 'little child' and has a relationship
with God as their Father.</li>
<li>All of these are clearly referring to stages of development that all believers experience.</li>
<li>NT often uses physical growth to illustrate spiritual growth. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Ephesians 4" target="_blank">cf. Ephesians 4</a></li>
<li>Not all Christians are either mature fathers or spiritually strong young men; there is a

<p>
<b>The true Christian loves God because of the forgiveness of his sins and a new relationship
with God as Father.</b>
</p>

<p>
'forgiven' - perfect tense; lit. 'send away', 'release from legal or moral obligation or
penalty', 'cancel or pardon'. Every Christian has been freed from legal guilt before God, and
has had our sentence canceled.
</p>

<p>
'sins' - plural; all of them, in total; thoughts, attitudes, words, acts, past, present, and
future have all been wiped away: this is our confidence. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Colossians 2:13" target="_blank">Colossians 2:13</a>
</p>

<p>
Note that this is not <i>relational</i> forgiveness, or reconciliation; rather, this is legal
forgiveness that happens once and for all. This forgiveness comes with God's adoption of us,
a new relationship in which we <i>now</i> can be reconciled with God.
</p>

<p>
Further, we don't just receive forgiveness, but also Christ's perfect righteousness: His
obedient human life credited to us. We are forever righteous with His righteousness.
</p>

<p>
'for His name's sake' - not because we deserve it or earned it, but for the exaltation of
Jesus' name. Our hope for salvation rests in Christ and His work alone.
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Acts 4:12; 10:43" target="_blank">Acts 4:12; 10:43</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Matthew 1:21" target="_blank">Matthew 1:21</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:2; 4:10" target="_blank">2:2; 4:10</a>
</p>

<p>
Do you believe that your sins are forgiven? On what <i>basis</i> do you believe they are forgiven?
If it is anything but the fact that Christ stands as your representative before God; that His
substitutionary death, life, and resurrection are what atones for your sin; you are not a
believer.
</p>

<p>
The second use of 'children' is a different Greek word, speaking to immaturity, and a need
to listen to and obey their father.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1" target="_blank">2:29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1</a> We become God's children by the new birth.</li>

</ul>

<p>
The spiritual child sees God not as some impersonal power, but as our Father who has adopted
and forgiven us legally of our sins.

'you have known Him' - perfect tense; also a sense of progression, 'you have grown in your
knowledge of Him'.
</p>

<p>
Knowledge of who? God the Father? This would mean John repeats himself from verse 13; and
John never refers to the first person of the Trinity as anything but 'God' or 'The Father'.
So John here is referring to knowing Christ: a mature knowledge of the person of Christ, not

<li><b>Spiritual growth is inevitable.</b> In the same way physical growth is an inevitable, slow
and steady process. A spiritual flatline shows no sign of spiritual life in you at all; if
you don't have a spiritual pulse, it's because you don't have spiritual life.</li>
<li><b>Spiritual growth is like physical growth.</b> It's not a snap change, but rather a slow,
painful process; there is no 'secret method' by which you vault into the next 'tier' of
growth.</li>
<li><b>Spiritual growth is by means of God's Word.</b> Our victory against sin began when sin's
power over us is broken at salvation; not to say we stop sinning entirely, or that the war
is over; rather, that progress is being made in that war. This progress is made through
knowledge and understanding of the Word of God, which is living in them as they seek to
obey it. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Psalm 119:9" target="_blank">Psalm 119:9</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 17:17" target="_blank">John 17:17</a>
You can study the Word and not grow; but you cannot grow <i>without</i> studying the Word,
deeply and carefully. If you are not growing, you have not been readily praying and/or
consuming God's Word, in a similar way that lack of physical growth marks some lack of the
necessities of life: food, sleep, etc.</li>

John is not saying 'stop it', but rather 'don't start it', given to whom he's speaking. He is
referring not to something that happens <i>to you</i> or comes <i>upon you</i>, but rather to a
decision <i>you make</i>.
</p>

<p>
The key elements to this context are those of <i>affection</i> and <i>devotion</i>.
</p>

<p>
'the world' - Grk. 'kosmos', a word used regularly in the NT. It describes 'order' or
'arrangement'; an ordered system, as opposed to chaos. There are different senses in which it
is used:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The universe Romans 1:20 Acts 17:24</li>
<li>All intelligent life, men and angels 1 Corinthians 4:9</li>
<li>The earth Romans 4:13 1 Corinthians 5:10</li>
<li>Mankind, as a whole John 3:16</li>
<li>Fallen humanity in its opposition to God 1 John 5:19</li>
<li><b>An organized system created and ruled by Satan that dominates fallen humanity and is
alienated from and hostile to God</b> James 4:4</li>
</ol>

<p>
This lattermost is what John has in view, here.
</p>

<p>
'All that goes into making up the organized system evil on this Earth [&#x2026;] includes such
elements as all unregenerate men, their thoughts, attitudes, purposes, and desires; all
influences and forces that are opposed to God; and the patterns of evil practice that
characterize life apart from God.' 
</p>

<p>
Harrison, the Evangelical Dictionary of Theology: 'The powers of spiritual evil which have
Satan as their head, and appear to be organized on a vast scale and with great efficiency.
These powers dominate the life of unredeemed humanity. Satan rules a kingdom which is opposed
to the kingdom of God.' <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Luke 11:18" target="_blank">cf. Luke 11:18</a>

<li>It's supported by satanically inspired philosophy, religion, and pragmatic viewpoints.
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 4:5" target="_blank">1 John 4:5</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=2 Corinthians 10:5" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 10:5</a></li>

John gives three phrases describing that which is of the world: the trinity the world loves,
adores, and worships. Evil will always trace back to these three traits, in some
combination. They are all <i>internal</i>, not <i>external</i>: it's what happens in the human heart.

These three have legitimate parallels to the temptation of Eve in the Garden, and to the

This craving has its source in the Flesh: man's fallen nature. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Ephesians 2:3" target="_blank">Ephesians 2:3</a> says lit.
'indulging the <i>wills</i> of the flesh and the thoughts' - to do whatever our bodies will to

of something that is true about you. Status, popularity, achievement, wealth, power,
position, possessions, education, intellect, culture, honors, race, abilities, etc. It is
the desire to be greater than others; base desires, false values, and egotism.
</p>

<p>
This can also cause people to 'adapt' the truth to fit with the culture of the current age.
</p>

<p>
This is the desire to warp a right desire to promote the glory of God into a desire to
promote the glory of oneself.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org85b4217">
<p>
'the last hour' - this phrase reflects God's redemptive plan, and where we are in that
timeline. It only appears here in this verse, but similar expressions ('the last days') are
used for end-time events in the OT; Jesus uses 'the last day' to refer to various end-time
events; Peter refers to the events of Pentecost as 'the last days'; Paul in <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=2 Timothy 3:1" target="_blank">2 Timothy 3:1</a>
uses it to refer to the church age. This shows it's a fluid term.
</p>

<p>
So 'the last hour' here refers to the time between the first and second coming of Jesus
Christ: the church age. This is the final step of human history before redemption is
completed. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 Peter 4:7" target="_blank">1 Peter 4:7</a>
</p>

<p>
False Christians will defect from the true church because it is the last hour, and Satan's
opposition will focus on damaging the church.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orged68801">
<p>
Fractured churches and false teachers drawing people away are his primary goal.
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">The</span> Antichrist is Coming. The word 'antichrist' only appears in John's writings: one who
is opposed to Christ, or sometimes one who is a counterfeit of Christ. This culminates
eventually in a person in the end times. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=2 Thessalonians 2:3-4" target="_blank">2 Thessalonians 2:3-4</a> He is a usurper.
</p>

<p>
John himself explains the term briefly. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:22; 4:3" target="_blank">2:22; 4:3</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=2 John 1:7" target="_blank">2 John 1:7</a> In this verse in particular,
he's not referring to the <i>spirit</i> of antichrist (the attitude of being opposed to Christ
pervasive in this world), but rather the coming person, as John phrases it 'is coming', not
'has come'.
</p>

<p>
Satan's plan culminates with the appearance of this person, the Antichrist; but he has
already begun to work toward that goal: <span class="underline">Many</span> Antichrists Are Already Here.
</p>

<p>
Jesus prophesied that many false prophets and false messiahs would arrive. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Matthew 24:4-5" target="_blank">Matthew 24:4-5</a>
Why would Satan initiate this onslaught of false christs, false prophets, and false
teachers? Christ is the only threat to Satan's kingdom on this earth, and he furiously works
to attack the church of Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 4:1,3" target="_blank">4:1,3</a> The denial of Christ and what Scripture says about Him marks these false teachers. It
is one of two kinds of people:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Purveyors of false religion that are opposed to Christ, just like the final Antichrist
will be.</li>
<li>False teachers attached to the Christian faith, who claim to support Christ, but are
actually opposed to the biblical Jesus.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Consider who John was writing regarding: those who were teaching false things about Christ.
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Acts 20:30" target="_blank">Acts 20:30</a> We must be on the alert to this danger within even faithful churches. They will
say they are for Christ, but teach the opposite. They cause people to defect from true
churches.
</p>

<p>
Satan's goal, then, is to flood the true church with as many antichrists as he can.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org98c8a45">
<p>
Caveat: There are true believers scattered amongst false churches; this is because they
believe things that that false church does not in fact teach. And true Christians can be
tempted and swayed by serious error, for a time; and untaught Christians can remain in error
for longer. But genuine believers don't leave true churches for false churches.

</p>

<p>
Be careful not to abuse this verse; attending another biblically orthodox church is not a
sign that they are not saved. 'us' here refers to all true believers.
</p>

<p>
Instead, this verse refers to those who - still claiming to be true believers - withdrew
from the biblical church. In our time, this is wholly pervasive. The Roman Catholic church
(false works-based gospel), Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons (false Jesus and God, and
different gospel), liberal protestantism (abandoning the biblical gospel and God), Church
of Christ (baptism as required for salvation), etc.

<p>
Evangelical leaders have defected to teach unbiblical doctrines; now, those who embrace
radical notions of social justice over the gospel are doing likewise; and those who have
followed these defections have quickly exited the church. This is God's means by which to
reveal clearly the distinction between those He has saved and those He has not.

<p>
Many false Christians <b>attend</b> true churches: passing the doctrinal test, affirming
Scripture's teachings, but having never truly repented or transformed: no evidence of
obedience to Jesus and His Word, or lack of love for God and His people.
Only at the judgment will this distinction be fully made known. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Matthew 7" target="_blank">Matthew 7</a>
</p>

<p>
Many false Christians <b>eventually defect</b> from true churches. These may even appear to pass
the other tests: outwardly moral, and seeming to have a genuine love for God and people in
general. But in spurning the church and other genuine believers, or in failing to hold to
right doctrine, they show that it is at most a superficial state.

<p>
Grk. 'krisma' (?) - the focus is on the <i>substance</i> you are anointed with, not the <i>act</i> of
anointing. Throughout Scripture - OT and NT - anointing with oil symbolizes being set apart
by God for a specific role, and empowered for that role by God.

<p>
lit. 'you are having an anointing' - it has already occurred in the past, and it continues
even now.

<p>
At salvation, in regeneration, we received the anointing: that being the Holy Spirit. This
was promised in the New Covenant promises. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Ezekiel 36:25-27" target="_blank">Ezekiel 36:25-27</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 14:17" target="_blank">John 14:17</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Acts 5:32" target="_blank">Acts 5:32</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 8:9" target="_blank">Romans 8:9</a>
</p>

<p>
This is inextricably coupled with salvation, and is even the means of salvation. At that
moment when the Spirit gave you life, He let you see that the Scripture is God's Word, and
that the Gospel was true. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 8:43" target="_blank">John 8:43</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 Corinthians 2:14" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 2:14</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=2 Corinthians 4:3-6" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 4:3-6</a>

<p>
This is why we refer to the work of the Spirit as 'irresistible grace' - not that God drags
you kicking and screaming to the truth; He does not coerce. Rather, man's will is not
violated. Rather, it frees man's will, opening our eyes so we can accurately to compare the
glory of sin to the glory of God. Only the blind hold to their sin. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Acts 26:18" target="_blank">Acts 26:18</a>

God implants in the believer that can see and understand spiritual truth. God is the one who
is the ultimate cause; the Spirit is the <i>efficient</i> cause, and the Word is the
<i>instrumental</i> cause. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=James 1:18" target="_blank">James 1:18</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 3:8" target="_blank">John 3:8</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=2 Thessalonians 2:14" target="_blank">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 Peter 1:23" target="_blank">1 Peter 1:23</a>

<p>
The Spirit does not deliver us new information, but rather teaches from His Word.
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Psalm 119:12,33,64" target="_blank">Psalm 119:12,33,64</a> and many more besides in this chapter alone testify to this.
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 16:13" target="_blank">John 16:13</a> tells of the Spirit's enablement of the apostles to write the New Testament; but
as we read and study, the Spirit guides us likewise to all the truth we need to know through
their writings.
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 Corinthians 2" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 2</a> outlines the Spirit's work in our lives through the Scripture, by His
inspiration of Scripture and illumination of it to us, ensuring we understand it and apply
it rightly.
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Psalm 119:130" target="_blank">Psalm 119:130</a> shows the result of the Spirit's work.
</p>

<p>
How, then, do we define illumination? J.I. Packer: "It is not a giving of new revelation, but
a work within us that helps us grasp and love the [&#x2026;] Illumination is thus the applying of
God's revealed truth to our hearts so that we grasp as reality for ourselves [&#x2026;]"

<p>
'<i>The</i> liar' - the quintessential liar. There are no 'complementary truths'; no
contradictions can both be true. In such a case, there can only be truth and error (or both
error).
</p>

<p>
The denial is of the fact that the man Jesus of Nazareth is the divine Messiah and the
eternal Son of God.
</p>

<p>
The pre-gnostic heresy held that body and matter is evil, and spirit is good. Cerinthus
taugh this heresy, and held that God could therefore not be embodied.
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 4:2-3" target="_blank">4:2-3</a> responds even more clearly to this heresy. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 5:5-6" target="_blank">5:5-6</a> addresses the corollary false claim
that God went into Jesus at baptism and left him at the crucifixion.
</p>

<p>
If this is false, what is true? Jesus has two natures: He is fully God, and fully man.
</p>

<p>
This false claim rejects the nature of God as trinity, the eternality of Christ, the
incarnation of Christ, the work of Christ (if only the 'human' Jesus died on the cross,
there is no salvation of sins); the results are utterly catastrophic! To deny who Christ is
undermines our faith wholly.

'That which you have heard from the beginning' - the biblical Gospel of our Lord, revealed in

Matthew 19:16</a> The kingdom of God is received as a gift alone, as a
child; not earned. The young man was wrong about sin, beliving Jesus as a mere man had
attained a level of righteousness, doing enough good things to get into the kingdom,
instead of understanding He was Holy God Himself. No human could be good except for God.
This young man thought he could <i>bribe</i> God with good works to let him into the kingdom!
Jesus' reply went directly to the heart of the young man, and put his finger on his heart's
true idol, what he truly worships and in which he puts his faith: his wealth.
</p>

<p>
The judgment is not based on a scale of good outweighing bad. It is based on perfection,

Easy-believism is one occurrence of this: it teaches saving faith is solely <i>intellectual
assent</i> to the historical <i>facts</i> of the Gospel. Charles Ryrie and Zane Hodges from the
Dallas Theological Seminary (?) were prominent promulgators of this, but it is seen across
the country. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 10:9-10" target="_blank">Romans 10:9-10</a> You must confess Jesus as <i>Lord</i> - not merely acknowledge <i>who</i>
He is, but ascribe to Him the <i>relationship</i> of Lord to you, His faithful slave. To claim
you know Christ while living a life of sin is to show you do not have real saving faith.
</p>

<p>
Antinomianism is similar - literally meaning 'against the law', it redefines it to exclude
repentance, the lordship of Christ, and a changed life. It denies that it matters what the
content of the Christian life is. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Ezekiel 36:25-27" target="_blank">Ezekiel 36:25-27</a> Those who God saves will exhibit the

There are only two options for origins:
a. Matter is eternal
b. God created all things
</p>

<p>
Either way, you are ascribing divine attributes, either to matter or to God: either matter
has eternity, power, and intelligence; or those are the properties of God who created all
things. Which of those makes sense, ultimately? Only God.

<p>
We sin against our conscience, what we know to be right; and this conscience falls short
of God's law in setting a standard to begin with!
</p>

<p>
Those who appear to be good people are not good in the way God requires; they are good in
a relative way only, in a similar way as we say 'there is honor among thieves'; they are
still guilty of radical treason and rebellion against their rightful King.

<p>
This does <i>not</i> mean we know all spiritual truth we need to know; John has already spoken
about degrees of spiritual maturity.

'is true and is not a lie' - as the Spirit is the Spirit of truth, He teaches us only that
which is true, and He does so by helping us understand the Scripture He inspired.

The Spirit continues to teach each believer how to distinguish between truth and error.
This does not mean no believer will believe any error, but rather from any error that
would damn your soul: it preserves the necessary truths.
</p>

<p>
'The Holy Spirit indwells the true believer and enables him to discern heretical error.'
It is like a resident lie detector that recognizes teaching that leads to damning error.

<p>
If you have honestly taken these three tests of eternal life, <i>you can know whether you
have eternal life.</i>
</p>

<p>
If you have demonstrated:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A pattern of obedience to Christ and His Word,</li>
<li>A love for God and His people, and</li>
<li>Belief in the biblical Jesus and the biblical Gospel</li>
</ul>
<p>
&#x2026; Then you have eternal life. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 5:13" target="_blank">1 John 5:13</a>
</p>

<p>
If you have <i>failed</i> any one of these three tests, then understand /you are not a true
Christian; you are a false Christian. You have persuaded yourself you are the real deal,
but you are not, and you need to be reconciled to God: to repent and believe the true
Gospel.
</p>

<p>
The Holy Spirit produces these realities in genuine believers.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org08860b0">
<p>
'abide' - stay, remain, continue; 'not to leave a certain realm or sphere'.
</p>

<p>
This is to persevere in Christ and His gospel, following and obeying Him. This is an active
command, not a passive state: 'be abiding', 'be persevering' in Him.
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:24; 3:6" target="_blank">cf. 2:24; 3:6</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 8:30-32; 15:6" target="_blank">John 8:30-32; 15:6</a> True believers continue believing, obeying, and following.
Those who fall away never were genuine followers of Christ to begin with, and they are simply
showing the lack of fruit they've always had.
</p>

<p>
How? By a growing knowledge of Scripture, which strengthens our faith. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 10:17" target="_blank">Romans 10:17</a>
</p>

<p>
Persevering is only possible because we are protected by the power of God, through the Spirit;
through the intercession of Christ; through the eternal love of the Father. Our duty, until
Christ comes, is to remain and abide in Him.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org19536ae">
<p>
'when' here can be translated as 'if', but the word in Greek can also be used as 'whenever' -
consequence, not conditional.
</p>

<p>
'coming' - Grk. 'parousia', lit. 'alongside-of'; came to mean 'presence', and is used to refer
to Christ's return often. He won't merely reappear, but He will be present with His people.
</p>

<p>
Why abide in Him? So that when Christ appears, each believer may have the right response.
</p>

<p>
One view says that the two groups are two groups of believers; but in context, that cannot be
a right interpretation, since those who do not abide are not genuine believers, as John has
repeatedly made clear.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, this is showing the difference between true and false Christians.

<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-org7fc64d7">
<p>
'confidence' - lit. 'all-speech' in Grk.; used to refer to <i>freedom of speech</i>, and took on
a larger meaning of boldness and confidence in any context.
</p>

<p>
This word is used of the boldness we have to come before God and speak to Him in prayer!

</p>

<p>
Likewise, when we stand before Christ as our judge, we will not have any fear of
condemnation. If we seek to honor and live for Christ, you will have the freedom to appear
before Him confidently and speak to Him boldly and with assurance. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 4:17" target="_blank">4:17</a>

<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-orge7e9946">
<p>
'shrink away' - only used here in John's writings, and it has two possible senses; a
subjective feeling of shame, shrinking away from Christ in shame; or an active shaming and
disgrace by Christ Himself, and this seems more likely in light of passages such as
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Matthew 7:23" target="_blank">Matthew 7:23</a> and other similar parables.
</p>

<p>
Those who live in patterns of sin - who claim Christ as Lord, but do not obey Him as such -
will be put to shame. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Mark 8:38" target="_blank">Mark 8:38</a>
</p>

<p>
Those who were merely nominal in their allegiance of Christ will be rejected by Him; if they
were separated from Him in life, they will be separated from Him in eternity. If they were
united with Him in life, they will be united with Him in eternity. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Ephesians 2:4-5" target="_blank">Ephesians 2:4-5</a>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgc14f7c6">
<p>
The focus shifts from Jesus to the Father, as we are never described as being 'born of Jesus',
but always 'born of the Father'. So 'that He is righteous' refers to the Father.
</p>

<p>
The logical consequence - everyone who practices righteousness shows that their father is the 
Father of righteousness: God Himself; like Father, like son. They are showing evidence that
they have already been born of God, sharing the nature of their new parentage.
</p>

<p>
This is referring not to a relative moral state, not a balancing of the scales; but rather the
habitual practice. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:6" target="_blank">2:6</a> Are you in a pattern of walking in the light, or in the darkness? Of
walking in the righteousness of God, or wallowing in sin?
</p>

<p>
This is why salvation is often called the 'new birth' throughout the New Testament: it is the
work God does that produces righteousness in His children.

The highest quality of love. 'how great' - a phrase used to express amazement and wonder
at the kind or class love expressed. In <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Matthew 8:27" target="_blank">Matthew 8:27</a> the disciples used this same type of
expression. As Christ is a different kind of man from any they had seen, this love is
incomprehensibly greater than any we have ever known. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Ephesians 3:18-19" target="_blank">Ephesians 3:18-19</a>

<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-org6d7c507">
<p>
John doesn't merely say 'God loved us', but he says rather that God 'bestows love on us' -
this is the word 'to give'. God loves His people <i>not</i> because of anything in them, and
certainly not because we are desirable or lovable; but rather because of His sovereign
decision! He loves you because He loves you; unloved, undeserved, unmerited, unconditioned on
anything in us. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Deuteronomy 7:7-8" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>

This is a gift God is granting; it is not earned or purchased! It is given to us, and can
never be revoked! The verb tense in the Greek is 'past perfect' or similar; it is an action
that has been completed in full. He knew everything about you when He gave you His love, and
there is nothing in you that could cause Him to revoke it.

<p>
This does not mean we become sons exactly as Christ is! John 3:16 uses the word 'gneis' - 
one-of-a-kind, eternally the Son of God. We, however, are granted the rights of God's family
as those who are <i>not</i> naturally part of His family.
</p>

<p>
<i>Biblical Doctrine</i>: "God legally places regenerated and justified sinners into His family,
so that they become sons and daughters of God and thus enjoy all the rights and privileges of
one who is a member of God's eternal family."

(Berkhoff); the gradual process by which sin is rooted out of our lives, leading to increasing
christlikeness and decreasing patterns of sin.

<li><a id="orge3b5e96"></a>2. The Motivation for Sanctification - 'This hope fixed on Him'<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orge3b5e96">
<p>
The only time John uses the word 'hope'. The word refers not to 'desire' or 'wish' with any
lack of confidence or uncertainty, as we use it in English; but rather, desire combined with
certainty that it will happen, and an eager anticipation. 'Expectation' may be a better word,
for example.
</p>

<p>
Expectation of what? Those things listed in <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 3:2" target="_blank">v2</a>.
</p>

<p>
This expectation compels us to do battle with our flesh. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 Timothy 1:1" target="_blank">1 Timothy 1:1</a>
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Hebrews 10:23" target="_blank">Hebrews 10:23</a> This expectation is also grounded in the person of Christ; and our seeing and
sharing of Christ's glory.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="org1a8bc01"></a>Not a ritual but a real cleansing of heart and life<br />
<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-org1a8bc01">
<p>
LXX uses this word exclusively for ritual or ceremonial cleansing; but NT uses it also to
include moral, spiritual purification, as it does here. This meaning is made clear in the
subsequent paragraph.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org140d255"></a>Not an event but an ongoing process<br />
<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-org140d255">
<p>
Lit. 'everyone having this hope is purifying themselves' - we never arrive this side of
Heaven, but we are continually pursuing this process. This isn't a 'go to sleep immature,
wake up mature' switch that flips, but a gradual change.
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-org7a748f6">
<p>
Only the blood of Jesus can cleanse us from the stain of guilt before God. We contribute
nothing to our justification, to make ourselves acceptable to God. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 1:7; 2:2; 4:9" target="_blank">1:7; 2:2; 4:9</a>
</p>

<p>
However, God only changes our hearts as we expend maximum effort, using the means God has
provided, as He so consistently does. And so Paul in his epistle to the Philippians instructs
them to work out the results of their newly freed, justified state, knowing that that work is
made effective and bears fruit by God who is at work in them - and in us.

wholly incompatible.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org161806b">
<p>
'practices sin' - regularly, habitually misses the mark, the target set in God's Word for us to
obey. This does not mean Christians do not sin, as John has already made clear <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 1:7" target="_blank">1:7</a>; rather,
that habitual practice of sin is evidence against the genuineness of a professing believer's
salvation. A characteristic pattern of sin evidences lack of regeneration.
</p>

<p>
The 'practice' of sin is used in the same way as 'practicing medicine' or 'practicing law' -
consistent exercise in, making a 'career' of, a lifestyle marked by. 'lawlessness' is the
wholesale rejection of God's law - and this is a definition of sin, as John notes here! He
gives other definitions elsewhere, but this is the simplest, clearest, most direct, and indeed
most shocking.
</p>

<p>
Sin is not just a weakness, failure, missing of the mark, accidental deviation; but rather, an
act of knowing rebellion against our rightful King by flagrantly violating His law. And the
more of His law we know, the more actively we oppose it! In sin, you assert your own will
against the will and command of God. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 1-2,6-7" target="_blank">Romans 1-2,6-7</a>
</p>

<p>
God does not see the world as 'pretty decent people with a few bad apples', but rather He sees
<i>every human heart</i> as inherently lawless. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Matthew 13:41" target="_blank">Matthew 13:41</a>
</p>

<p>
Our real problem when it comes to God is our relationship to God's law; we rebel against it,
break it, and don't keep it. Jesus deals with both our positive need to keep the law, and our
negative need to make restitution for the broken law. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=2 Corinthians 5:21" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>

'appeared' - 'manifested', Christ's incarnation.

<p>
For what purpose? 'to take away sins' - all individual sins of His people; likely to carry it
off, not simply to shoulder it, like the scapegoat on the Day of Atonement which symbolically
bore the sins outside the camp, cast out into the wilderness. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Leviticus 16" target="_blank">Leviticus 16</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Isaiah 53:5-6" target="_blank">Isaiah 53:5-6</a>

in His death they may be cast away.

'His seed abides in him' - What is 'His seed'?
i.   The Word of God or gospel message - the means the Spirit uses to produce the new birth.

<p>
Consider Catholic 'Mortal' vs. 'Venal' sins, or Wesleyan 'Voluntary' vs. 'Involuntary'
sins.
</p>

<p>
This text doesn't make any distinctions, and 1 John 3:4 even obviates distinctions!
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="orgf2e1dcf"></a>ii.  The believer has two natures: an old nature that continues to sin and a new nature that cannot.<br />
<div class="outline-text-9" id="text-orgf2e1dcf">
<p>
Paul's point in <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 6" target="_blank">Romans 6</a> (7?) was not to say he has two natures, but that sin is no longer
characterizing his new nature. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=2 Corinthians 5:17" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>
</p>

<p>
The flesh remains and is unredeemed, and that's where the struggle with sin continues. Yet
you are a new creation!

he is speaking of all believers!

'<i>No one</i>' - this is clearly out of the question.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org082f94c"></a>v.   A genuine Christian does not and cannot practice sin as a persistent pattern of life.<br />
<div class="outline-text-9" id="text-org082f94c">
<p>
This best fits the immediate context and the testimony of the rest of Scripture.
</p>

<p>
'Christians aren't <i>doing</i> sin' - again, the deliberate overphrasing points to the act of
persistently <i>doing</i>, practicing.
</p>

<p>
The word 'can' is Grk. 'dynomai', lit. referring to ability. They do not have the <i>ability</i>
to remain in a habitual pattern of sin. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 6:1-2" target="_blank">Romans 6:1-2</a> Not perfect obedience, but a pattern
of obedience.
</p>

<p>
'Truceless antagonism to sin' is the mark of a believer's life. 'Christians are not wholly
free from all vice, but heartily strive to form their lives in obedience to God. Sin does
not reign in them [&#x2026;]' - John Calvin
</p>

<p>
'The believer may fall into sin, but he will not walk in it.'
</p>

<p>
'He is demanding of life which is ever on the watch against sin. [&#x2026;]' - Barkley

'Everyone not doing righteousness is not out of God' - If you do not keep the commands of
God, your origin is not found in God. Only those found in God have the power to and are
made by the Spirit to practice - to walk in - righteousness!
</p>

<p>
The world talks a <i>lot</i> about the priority of love, and often for 'humankind' as a whole.

<p>
Scripture holds us higher than a sentimental standard, however; rather, we are to love

superficial 'word-but-not-deed' philanthropy. Ultimately, this 'love' is self-serving, an
expanded selfishness; loving those who love them. Genuine, self-sacrificial love is only
exhibited in fragments by the grace of God.
</p>

<p>
If you only engage in warm, loving relationships with those who are like you, you are no
different than a pagan. There may be some real love unbelievers harbor towards believers - who
are wholly unlike them - but it is never <i>because</i> they are believers.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org1732952">

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org84706c2">
<p>
Cain is a perfect example of an unbeliever who did not love his brother, because he was 'of
the evil one', i.e. the Devil; a child of the Devil, as John had just discussed. How do we
know this? Because the son manifests the traits of the father, and as the Devil is a murderer
by nature, so Cain reflects that in his own murderous heart.
</p>

<p>
Satan - in his pride - became totally self-centered, and thus fell. When self-centeredness is
frustrated, what is the response? Anger, hatred, and attacks on the one frustrating those
desires: in this case, God Himself. This attitude is exhibited on full display in <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Genesis 3" target="_blank">Genesis 3</a>.
</p>

<p>
Verbal assault, slander, and murder are all marks of this murderous, hateful, Satanic heart
that is held by all children of the Devil.
</p>

<p>
'Cain <i>slew</i> his brother' - this word 'slew' only appears here and in Revelation; in the
Septuagint, it's used to refer to the slaughter of animals: butchery, slaughter, cutting the
throat. It speaks of brutal, merciless, vicious, violent murder.
</p>

<p>
This very hatred marks all unbelievers - not always to its maximal expression, but the heart
is still filled with malice, a desire to hurt and inflict suffering out of spite. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Titus 3:3" target="_blank">Titus 3:3</a>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 3:9-18" target="_blank">Romans 3:9-18</a> People may never pick up a gun or a knife, but they will spew out words from

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org92b7468">
<p>
What motivated Cain to brutally butcher his brother? "Because his deeds were evil, and his
brother's were righteous." Their deeds showed the content of their characters. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Genesis 4" target="_blank">Genesis 4</a>
assumes they knew what God expected of them in sacrifice, having the example of God's
sacrifice of blood to clothe Adam and Eve, and the full knowledge of the events by which Adam
and Eve had brought the Fall. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Hebrews 11:4" target="_blank">Hebrews 11:4</a> So in full knowledge, Cain's rebellion against God
was explicit, bringing the sacrifice <i>he</i> wanted to bring.
</p>

<p>
If you try to bring your own merit before God, your sacrifice is the sacrifice of Cain:
rebellious, an affront to God, and unacceptable to Him. And Cain's response to God's
confrontation further reveals the content of his heart!
</p>

<p>
Not only is Cain's heart revealed, but the sharp contrast with Abel's righteous heart provoked
Cain's envy and jealousy - which matures into murder and violence consistently.
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Genesis 37:4,18" target="_blank">Genesis 37:4,18</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Matthew 27:18" target="_blank">Matthew 27:18</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=James 4:1-2" target="_blank">James 4:1-2</a> What manner of evil is this, that self-interest
boils over into envy, resentment, anger, hatred, malice, quarreling, violence, and finally
murder? It is the evil in the heart of every man apart from God.
</p>

<p>
Unbelievers don't envy the righteous character of the righteous; but rather, to be accepted
as the righteous are, but on their own terms. They hate the condemnation they feel: "You're
judging us." Seeing righteousness, they feel condemned, and this begins the churning of hatred
in the heart. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Genesis 19" target="_blank">Genesis 19</a>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org39734ae">
<p>
Am I marked by self-centeredness, and how do you respond regularly and consistently when your
self-interest is crossed? Blowing up or clamming up? Desiring to hurt them, either in your
thoughts, or in caustic words, or in physical violence? How do you treat the people who live in
your house and your close circles? Do you consistently treat them like Cain treated his
brother?
</p>

<p>
If these mark you, then like Cain, you are still of the evil one; still abide in spiritual
death; and do not have eternal life abiding in you. It is impossible to have the divine nature
dwelling within you and to continue to be like Cain.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if your heart is marked by a genuine love for others: quick to forgive as
you have been forgiven; speaking honest words to build up in grace, to nurture relationships;
if your consistent response is genuine, self-sacrificial love, then you have assurance that
eternal life is in you.

'We know' - the added pronoun in the Greek puts emphasis on '<i>we</i>'.
</p>

<p>
'passed out of death into life' - moving; the language of immigration, of changing
territories and countries. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Colossians 1:13" target="_blank">Colossians 1:13</a>
</p>

<p>
This is also the language of resurrection; true believers have experienced a spiritual
resurrection in the past. The Greek uses 'the death' and 'the life' to emphasize these are
<i>the</i> spiritual states of death and life. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 5:12" target="_blank">Romans 5:12</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Ephesians 2:1" target="_blank">Ephesians 2:1</a> All are born spiritually
dead, which results in our physical and eternal death in the Lake of Fire. We must needs be
born again, given new life; we are now alive to God, conscious of and living in fellowship
with God. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 5:24" target="_blank">John 5:24</a> is now true of John and those believers to whom he writes.
</p>

<p>
How do we know this happened to us? '[&#x2026;] because we love the brethren' - lit. 'because we
are loving the brothers', a characteristic, continual pattern of love for our fellow
believers. This does not earn us eternal life, but it provides evidence of that life. It is
<i>the</i> primary mark of genuine saving faith, the firstfruit of the Spirit.
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 Corinthians 13:13" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 13:13</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Galatians 5:22" target="_blank">Galatians 5:22</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Colossians 1:4" target="_blank">Colossians 1:4</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 13:35" target="_blank">John 13:35</a>

<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Hebrews 10:25" target="_blank">Hebrews 10:25</a> This is also why genuine believers do not forsake the church. You show me a
professing Christian who is content week-after-week, year-after-year to forsake fellowship
with fellow believers, and I'll show you someone for whom we should carry grave concerns
about their profession of faith.

"Fallen human nature is selfish and resists any claim on its time that conflicts with its

There is no middle ground, as we saw in <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:9-10" target="_blank">2:9-10</a>. You either love, or you hate.
</p>

<p>
What about the world's concept of indifference? That's not how God thinks! There's no neutral
ground, because of the nature of God's moral law: it is not merely negative, but rather
primarily positive. It tells us what we <i>should</i> do.
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Exodus 20:3-17" target="_blank">Exodus 20:3-17</a> shows a condensation of
the Ten Commandments: eight are negatively stated ('You shall not'), but two are positively
stated ('You shall', indirectly). God's law also demands that we do the <i>opposite</i> of what
each negative commands forbid: 'love and worship Him alone, from our hearts and only in the
way He describes, keeping Him and all things related to Him holy.'  'Honor the human
authorities in our lives.' 'Take every step to preserve our lives and the lives of others.'
'Enjoy sexual activity only within the bounds He has made.' etc.
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Matthew 22:36-40" target="_blank">Matthew 22:36-40</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 13:8-10" target="_blank">Romans 13:8-10</a> Jesus and Paul alike pointed to the <i>positive</i> demand of the
law as being its fulfillment, not just avoiding the <i>negative</i> demands. Love is the perfect
fulfillment of the demands of the law, and anything less than that is hatred.

<li><a id="org607693b"></a>b. If you hate someone, you have broken the sixth commandment against murder in your heart.<br />
<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-org607693b">
<p>
'murder' - the Greek word here is for 'mankiller', used also in <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 8:44" target="_blank">John 8:44</a> to describe Satan's
murderous heart that desires to see mankind butchered.
</p>

<p>
God doesn't just demand the actions of His law, but that we carry the spirit of His laws in
our hearts! We aren't to harbor murderous desire in our heart whilst never acting on it.
That's not to say murder is not significantly worse, but rather that this heart attitude is
still equally damning and makes you equally guilty before the law of God, equally guilty of
eternal punishment.
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Matthew 5:21-22" target="_blank">Matthew 5:21-22</a> Jesus equated anger in the heart with murderous intent! If you were
prosecuted based on this evidence of your heart, you would be found guilty and would go into
Hell. Your desire in that anger is that they would perish, and be out of your life: murder
of the heart.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org4d3da73"></a>c. If you are characterized by patterns of anger and hatred (and thereby murder in the heart), you do not have eternal life.<br />
<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-org4d3da73">
<p>
This does not mean you are beyond God's redemption, but rather that this pattern in present
reality is evidence you have certainly not received that redemption yet. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Galatians 5" target="_blank">Galatians 5</a>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Revelation 21:8" target="_blank">Revelation 21:8</a>
</p>

<p>
If you believe you are a Christian, take stock and examine yourself: do you consistently love
Christians? Then you have eternal life. Do you consistently fail to love Christians? Then you
do not have eternal life.
</p>

<p>
To fail to break even one commandment is to break the whole law; since the law is unified and
demands perfect obedience, we cannot keep the rest if we have broken one, just like
shattering a pane of glass.
</p>

<p>
Christ lived a perfect life of righteousness, perfectly keeping the law of God. The only way
for us to be made right with God is to put our faith in His perfect life, obedient death, and
sealing resurrection. By this means alone is His righteousness credited to us. We follow Him,
becoming His disciple and walking in His ways alone.

'laid down' - Grk. word used to word 'laying aside' something, such as a piece of clothing.
Jesus demonstrated love by deliberate, voluntary self-sacrifice. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 10:11-18; 15:13" target="_blank">John 10:11-18; 15:13</a>
His love for His people motivates His sacrificial actions, laying down His own life
voluntarily to purchase our redemption.
</p>

<p>
"Since one's own life is an individual's most precious possession, Christ's willingness to lay
down that life for others constitutes the greatest act of love."
</p>

<p>
As opposed to Cain, who slew his righteous brother - the ultimate act of selfishness - Christ
considers the good of the other, <i>giving</i> His life for sinful men. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Ephesians 5:2,25" target="_blank">Ephesians 5:2,25</a>

<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-orgb5e3541">
<p>
Our hearts know more about us than others, and thus can raise the alarm, declaring us guilty
as it knows of even our secret sins and the guilt they ought to incur before holy God. Our
conscience and our thoughts are made by God to condemn us and bring us to the reality of our
state, our lack of and need for righteousness. The basic requirement of God's moral law is
indelibly printed on every human heart. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 2:14-15" target="_blank">Romans 2:14-15</a>
</p>

<p>
The conscience is the courtroom of the soul, where moral decisions are constantly on trial.
This court came 'pre-loaded' with the basic requirements of God's law; the conscience
functions automatically, while our thoughts stand in the prosecution and defense of our own
decisions. Both often accuse us.
</p>

<p>
Even as believers, our hearts still condemn us at times because of our continuing sin, and we
need assurance. This is not <i>unsuual</i> for believers; this is the norm! Multiple Confessions
of Faith recognize that 'true believers may have their assurance shaken, diminished, or
intermitted; by not being careful to preserve it, by falling into special sin that wounds the
conscience, by facing vehement temptation, by God withdrawing the light of His countenance
for a time; yet are they never utterly destitute of that seat of God, light of faith, that
love of Christ and the brothers, the sincerity of the heart, conscience of duty, [&#x2026;]'
</p>

<p>
So, given the reality of the condemnation of our hearts, we can assuage this condemnation by
reminding ourselves of these tests, observing our own lives to point to it as evidence in
this court that we belong to Christ.

<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-orge5beb0a">
<p>
God understands the reality of our spiritual condition, and knows all things. Some say that
John is saying 'God knows our sin, and it's <i>worse</i> than the condemnation of our hearts.'
While this is true, it's not befitting the context: John isn't giving a <i>warning</i> here, and
it certainly wouldn't give assurance! John is speaking here about assurance and confidence
concerning your faith.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="org5be84ea"></a>i.   God knows that the condemnation of our hearts is sometimes false.<br />
<div class="outline-text-8" id="text-org5be84ea">
<p>
We can appeal to the fact that God knows our hearts, our motives, and the genuineness of our
love for Him. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Psalm 103:13-14; 139:1-6" target="_blank">Psalm 103:13-14; 139:1-6</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 21:17" target="_blank">John 21:17</a>
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org561ca8d"></a>ii.  God knows that He has forgiven the sins of which our hearts condemn us, and that we are still His children.<br />
<div class="outline-text-8" id="text-org561ca8d">
<p>
My heart may condemn and accuse us for these sins, but His court has already declared us
innocent by the blood of Christ. This was decreed not by our own merit, but by His good
mercy and pleasure. By this alone we have hope.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="orged739c0"></a>iii. God knows that our active love for other believers proves we've been born again in spite of the sins that condemn us.<br />
<div class="outline-text-8" id="text-orged739c0">
<p>
If we have true fellowship with one another and with God, the blood of Christ continues
cleansing us of all sins. He does not forget His saving intentions for each of us, but
does not fail to remember and continue that work.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="org59bf985"></a>1. "Stop listening to yourself and talk to yourself."<br />
<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-org59bf985">
<p>
This is one of the most important spiritual lessons Tom has ever learned. /Stop listening to
the wrong ideas your mind keeps spinning out, and instead start teaching the truth to your
own mind: preaching the truth of Scripture to yourself./
</p>

<p>
In the face of sin, temptation, and failure, you must apply the specific truths God has
given you for this very purpose.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org11b52db"></a>2. Assure your heart when it's condemning you with the divinely inspired tests in 1 John.<br />
<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-org11b52db">
<p>
When we see our life lived according to these tests John presents, God wants us to be truly
and wholly assured that it is true evidence of His saving faith in us, and the eternal life
we now have.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org63cde32">
<p>
'Beloved' - John loves these believers, but he also reminds them that they are beloved of God,
as well.
</p>

<p>
'we will assure our hearts' - this is a <i>command</i>, an expectation to use this test to settle
our hearts with His blessed assurance.
</p>

<p>
This is not a once-a-lifetime action, but 'whenever' - each time your heart condemns you,
return to these tests for your assurance.

lit. 'we are having confidence' - continual; not necessarily unbroken, but it is the ongoing

</p>

<p>
'confidence' - can mean outspokenness, frankness, plainness; or a state of being such,
especially before persons of high rank. John has the latter sense in view: 'before God'. As
our Father, we can speak openly (though still respectfully) to Him.
</p>

<p>
This does not give us authority to impugn His motives or to speak ill of God. But we rather
have confidence to come before Him with a right balance of awe and intimacy.

<p>
'you are keeping' - the consistent pattern of your life; making conscious efforts to obey
God's commands in the Scripture.
</p>

<p>
Don't misunderstand this relationship: obedience doesn't <i>earn</i> God's answer. It's a
condition, not the meritorious cause.
</p>

<p>
For example: the condition of winning the lottery is having the right ticket, but that ticket
doesn't earn you the money; it's merely the condition. Similarly, being related to a relative
doesn't earn you their inheritance; it's merely the condition.

This implies you're doing it with the right motive: <i>because</i> it pleases God, out of a desire

'believe' - the first use of this word in this epistle; the saving faith and personal

claimed Jesus was merely a man given divine power during the three years of his ministry.

</p>
<ol class="org-ol">

If you have believe, taking and passing this first test can give you great assurance: rest in
and trust in Christ and His promises. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 5:24; 10:27; 11:25-26" target="_blank">John 5:24; 10:27; 11:25-26</a>
</p>

<p>
This, however, is not the <i>sole means</i> of your assurance; all three tests are equally
important, essential, and vital, as the others examine the evidence of the genuineness of
this belief.

evidence of genuine faith in our life: the love for other believers given to us by God.

Obedience to God's commands is evidence you've been saved and that you possess eternal life.
</p>

<p>
What commandments are referred to? His very commands to love God and love one another, that
which Christ affirmed was the summary of all the law He gave. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 13:8-10" target="_blank">Romans 13:8-10</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Galatians 5:14" target="_blank">Galatians 5:14</a>

or experience alone!

When did God give us His Spirit?
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><i>Historically</i> at Pentecost <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Acts 2:1-4,22-24,33,36" target="_blank">Acts 2:1-4,22-24,33,36</a></li>

</ol>

<p>
How does the Spirit bring assurance? Three views:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>He gives us a sense of internal confidence. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Matthew 7" target="_blank">Matthew 7</a> refutes this as being a primary means
of assurance.</li>
<li>He assures us through a mystical inner voice, speaking directly to the heart. But this
would make this 'inner voice' more important than Scripture, and makes such assurance
entirely subjective, and therefore uncertain. And we know the Spirit's pattern is to work
through the Word.</li>
<li>He assures us through the Scripture alone. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 5:13" target="_blank">5:13</a></li>
</ol>

<p>
The Holy Spirit's Role in Assurance
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>He teaches us the biblical gospel and produces faith in us through our hearing and
understanding the Word. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:20,24,27; 4:2-3,6; 5:6-8" target="_blank">2:20,24,27; 4:2-3,6; 5:6-8</a></li>
<li>He creates love in us for our fellow Christians. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 4:12-13" target="_blank">4:12-13</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Galatians 5:16,22" target="_blank">cf. Galatians 5:16,22</a></li>
<li>He produces righteousness in us by using the Word. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:29" target="_blank">2:29</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=2 Corinthians 3:18" target="_blank">cf. 2 Corinthians 3:18</a></li>
</ol>

<p>
The Spirit then uses the presence of these fruits He has produced through the Scripture to
evidence our salvation. Whenever your heart condemns you, return to these evidences for
assurance.

<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-org7ff97ef">
<p>
'spirits' - behind every person claiming to teach the Christian faith is either the Holy
Spirit in the case of true Christianity, or a demon in the case of false 'christianity'. The
origin of the empowering spirit behind a teacher can be known by examining the content of
their teaching.
</p>

<p>
So, by observing the evidence of the content of the teaching, you can be knowing whether they
are teaching in truth or in error. There are other tests, but this is the first and most
immediately visible, oftentimes.

<li><a id="org569e872"></a>b. Its Confessional Form: "Confesses"<br />
<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-org569e872">
<p>
This is a continual, ongoing confession.
</p>

<p>
This word has two related nuances: openly affirming propositions, and confessing personal
allegiance to a person or the truth about that person. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 10:9-10" target="_blank">cf. Romans 10:9-10</a>
</p>

<p>

Lord.

</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org6f97ae2"></a>c. Its Christological Content: "Jesus Christ has come in the flesh"<br />
<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-org6f97ae2">
<p>
There are two options, here: Either focusing on the reality of the incarnation (facing the
Gnostics), or rather confessing 'Jesus Christ, who has come in the flesh' (Tom leans this
direction, with every word of the confession stressed, not just 'in the flesh').
</p>

<p>
The confession is that the Divine Messiah, Christ, Jesus of Nazareth, has come in flesh; not
merely taking up residence in a body, but rather that Jesus <i>is</i> the Messiah who has Himself
incarnated, and who continues in flesh after His crucifixion and resurrection, being now and
forever the God-man.
</p>

<p>
This is the fundamental Christian doctrine which can never be compromised.

<li><a id="orgcc7a864"></a>d. Its Diabolical Contrast: "The spirit of the antichrist"<br />
<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-orgcc7a864">
<p>
'Every spirit that does not confess <i>the</i> Jesus' is the lit. Greek. He is solitary, real, and
not 'open to interpretation'.
</p>

<p>
Even a teacher who <i>refuses</i> to proclaim or affirm the biblical Jesus meets this diabolical
standard. Those who claim to speak for Jesus but refuse to speak of Him are of Satan,
embodying in their teaching the spirit of antichrist: that which stands against and aims to
be a substitute for the true Christ.
</p>

<p>
'of which you have heard that it is coming' - they had been taught of the coming of the human
Satan would raise up as a diabolical alternative to Christ.
</p>

<p>
'and now it is already in the world' - while this man has not yet arrived, Satan stirs up
many teachers in like spirit. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=2 John 7" target="_blank">2 John 7</a>
</p>

<p>
Note that these are not the <i>only</i> truths you must believe: John cites these to counter false
teachers around those to whom John writes. What are the necessary confessions, then?

<p>
We must respond to the Gospel in the way God commands.
</p>

<p>
What is repentance?
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The recognition you have sinned. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Matthew 5:3" target="_blank">Matthew 5:3</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Luke 18:13-14" target="_blank">Luke 18:13-14</a></li>

<li>The determination to turn from everything you know to be sin in your life. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Acts 8:22" target="_blank">Acts 8:22</a> This
is a change in heart attitude, not cleaning yourself up before coming to Jesus; deserting,
abandoning the sinful intentions of your will, and submitting to Jesus' rightful rule as
the fruit of this turning.</li>
</ol>

<p>
You must also set your faith in Jesus Christ as Saviour-Lord.

<li>Knowing the Gospel <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 Corinthians 15:1a" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 15:1a</a></li>

<p>
'them' refers to the false teachers, sharing the same gender in the Greek as them and not
'spirits'.
</p>

<p>
'overcome' - Grk. 'nikao', 'prevailed against', 'conquered'; this is done by testing and
decisively rejecting false teachers and their teaching. While a believer may be influenced
by false teachers and teachings, they'll never embrace damning lies, by the power of the
Spirit.

<p>
How? 'Greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.' This is referring to two
personal beings ('he'), and in the immediate context this referring to the Holy Spirit.
This is the recurring theme of the NT, and of John in this epistle. 
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 3:24; 4:2" target="_blank">3:24; 4:2</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 14:17" target="_blank">John 14:17</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 5:5" target="_blank">Romans 5:5</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=2 Corinthians 1:22" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 1:22</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Galatians 4:6" target="_blank">Galatians 4:6</a>

<p>
The indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit protects us from error. See the sermons on
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:20,27" target="_blank">2:20,27</a>: John calls this 'the anointing'. When you are saved, the Holy Spirit teaches you
all the foundations of Christ and the Gospel, and you believe those things, and never give
them up. This is part of the process of regeneration, and as we live our new life in Christ
we grow in understanding of these truths. This growth is accomplished by the Spirit through
the Word. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 Corinthians 2:15" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 2:15</a>
</p>

<p>
Thus, these two means of victory are wholly intertwined and coupled.
</p>

<p>
'world' - an organized system, created and ruled by Satan, by which he deceives and
orchestrates evil and rules over fallen humanity; this entails all that is opposed to the
spiritual kingdom of Christ, in word and thought and deed. So 'he who is in the world' is
Satan himself. He is the greatest of all created beings <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Ezekiel 28" target="_blank">Ezekiel 28</a>, and is not to be trifled
with; yet the Holy Spirit is greater, and not by a small margin. No; the Spirit is greater
by infinite orders of magnitude, like the ocean to a single drop of water. There is no
contest.

<p>
lit. 'out of the world they are speaking' - all they can do is speak those same things the
world does: its philosophy, its content, its avoidance of or perversion of the things of
eternity. They distort and deform the message of God. It will not be about sanctification,
service, holiness, sin, God's character and His righteousness and justice, about carrying
the cross and trials. Rather, it will be about <i>self</i>, and the appeals of the flesh: worldly
'self-help' manuals regurgitated, playing to boastful human pride, and making human
salvation out to be a matter of human effort.
</p>

<p>
The Gospel, by contrast, tells man that all he can do for salvation is come before God as a
beggar, relying wholly and solely on Him for His grace unto salvation.
</p>

<p>
This can be done by twisting, adding to, or subtracting from the Scripture. And some even
get up and speak only their own words, neglecting the Scripture entirely while claiming to
speak on behalf of God.

gospel and its false teachers have such a broad following. It appeals to human desires, the

Based on these tests, you can discern who energizes a given teacher and his teaching: the
Holy Spirit, or Satan.

<p>
'spirit of truth' - refers to the Holy Spirit, not the general atmosphere of truth, given
John's regular use of this term. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13" target="_blank">John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13</a>

writings are the inspired word of God.
</p>

<p>
'inspired' - 'Theonoustos', appearing only here, 'God-breathed'; 'inspiration' is a poor
translation of such a word by Jerome. All Scripture is the product of the 'breath' of God,
just as your own words are the product of your breath. This book is the very word of God, and
every word in it is from God. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Luke 1:70" target="_blank">Luke 1:70</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 Corinthians 2:12-13" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 2:12-13</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=2 Peter 1:21" target="_blank">2 Peter 1:21</a>

Men were driven by the Spirit to speak those words that God sovereignly ordained, so that His
words would be perfectly expressed in their writing. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Matthew 5:18" target="_blank">Matthew 5:18</a> Not only is every
individual word inspired, but even the individual strokes that make them up were precisely
selected by God. Each individual stroke ('verbal inspiration') and the revelation of
Scripture as a whole ('plenary inspiration') both apply to the work of God.

Christ makes clear that all the words of Scripture will happen as God has promised - it is
wholly trustworthy.

The Scriptures are able to teach you - a sinner - how to be right with God. God Himself has
perfectly conveyed all we need for reconciliation by means of His Word.
</p>

<p>
They also teach how we may be sanctified; 'adequate' in here isn't 'just barely enough', but
rather wholly, perfectly capable, meeting every spiritual demand in life, and in full supply
of all needed to do all those righteous deeds God has set in store for us to do. We need look
nowhere else when this storeroom of God's own words to us is all-encompassingly sufficient.

There are 33 different verbs used to refer to teaching, but this word - 'karuso' is the main
one: 'to proclaim, as a king's messenger'; to speak with the authority of the king who sent
you. It's not a conversation, but a proclamation to be heard and obeyed. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 Timothy 4:11" target="_blank">1 Timothy 4:11</a>

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgdebf6c8">
<p>
Neither the Greek text nor the rest of Scripture allows those words to be reversed; love is
not God, and that is not all God is; and we are not pantheists, as that order would suggest.
</p>

<p>
In the rest of John's writing, he lists two other such statements:
God is Spirit, describing His metaphysical nature, not having a body as we do; and God is
Light, describing His moral nature, His holiness; and now, God is love.
</p>

<p>
The 'attributes' of God are better listed as 'perfections'. Attributes make it seem like
things <i>added</i> to God; but rather, we recognize that these are things which are the
essential characteristics of His nature, necessary to Him, and necessarily perfect. They are
not <i>parts</i> of God - there is no division in God; rather, His essence is identical to the sum
of His perfections. God does not <i>possess</i> love: He <i>is</i> love, fully, eternally, and
completely, in like manner to how He <i>is</i> holy, fully, eternally and completely.
</p>

<p>
God manifested this love within the Trinity before creation. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Matthew 3:17" target="_blank">Matthew 3:17</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 14:31; 17:24" target="_blank">John 14:31; 17:24</a>

<p>
John has moved from an exhortation to a statement of fact. If you want to know whether or not
you are a Christian, whether your profession of faith is true or false: <i>everyone continually
expressing biblical love for God and other believers</i>, 'out of God has been born'.
</p>

<p>
This tense shows a past event with continuing, ongoing results: the past event of having been
born again continues in its effects as manifested in the loving nature of a believer, the
family trait that is the identifying mark.
</p>

<p>
Lit. 'is knowing God'; we know Him as Father, growing in understanding and relationship with
Him; and, in doing so, habitually demonstrating it in loving God and other people. You cannot
know God in this way without your nature becoming loving as He is.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org8258ee4">
<p>
Again, the tense is a universal negative: they do not know God now, and never knew Him. For a
loveless Christian to claim to know God is to claim parentage who you do not even remotely
resemble, to claim friendship with one who has never even met you. It is a false profession,
and the person is deceived about the state of their soul.
</p>

<p>
If you are unloving as a pattern of life - unkind, critical, tearing others down in your mind
and with words, not overcoming the temptation of selfishness consistently so you can
practically care for others, marked by murderous thoughts and speech: <i>you are not born again
of God, and do not know Him.</i>

Grk. word ordering carries a different emphasis: "<b>His only begotten Son</b> He has sent."
</p>

<p>
Grk. 'monogneis' - 'only-begotten', the eternal relationship of Sonship that the Son had with
the Father, eternally before Creation. 'Only' speaks of His uniqueness; there is no other
with that relationship of Son to God the Father. 'begotten' - not created, but rather - while
still being one with God and still of the same essence, still co-equal with the other two
persons of the Trinity, this speaks to an <i>order of relations</i>. Jesus is the one-of-a-kind,
unique Son of God.

As God once revealed Himself through His Son, He now reveals Himself through His people. God
does not dwell in us <i>because</i> of our love, but rather our love is the outflow of the
indwelling of God in us: the evidence of His abiding presence.

God's love reaches its final intended goal when we - imitating the love of God for us - go on

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgc9822e2">
<p>
The following verses focus on the role of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers.
</p>

<p>
This theme of the indwelling Holy Spirit has been recurrent throughout this book. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 3:24; 4:2" target="_blank">3:24; 4:2</a>
</p>

<p>
'we' - all Christians; 'are knowing' - common knowledge among all believers
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=2 John 9" target="_blank">2 John 9</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:19" target="_blank">1 John 2:19</a> 'abide' is not some mystical term or some 'deeper faith', but is
repeatedly used of the basic assurance and living of the christian life, believing in the
biblical Jesus and the fundamental teaching of Scripture. This is remaining steadfastly in a
relationship with God the Father.
</p>

<p>
'He abides in us' - lit. 'is remaining in us'; we continually experience His abiding presence.
These are defining marks of those who are truly Christians!
</p>

<p>
To reword in a way that clarifies John's point:
'We know that we abide in Him and He in us by this: because He has given us of His Spirit.'
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 14:16-18; 15:26" target="_blank">John 14:16-18; 15:26</a>
</p>

<p>
'has given' - He gave it in the past, and we believers continue to have it. Given John is
writing to all believers, this must have happened at salvation, at the moment of regeneration -
and, indeed, is the means of regeneration. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Ezekiel 36:27" target="_blank">Ezekiel 36:27</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 8:9" target="_blank">Romans 8:9</a>

</p>

<p>
Jesus' work is defined here by John in a single word: 'Saviour'; He is the one who came to
rescue those who could not save themselves - and no one is able to. What did He save us from?
From spiritual death; from God's wrath against sin. The Father saves in ordaining the plan of
salvation and sending the Son; the Son saves in living a perfect, righteous life and dying a
propitiatory death; and the Spirit saves by applying the work of Christ.
</p>

All three tests come from here, the heart of the Gospel. Without the work of the Spirit, you
would never hear that Gospel.

vv20-21 are clearly about our love for other Christians, but in the other verses here there
are <i>five different kinds of love John could be talking about</i> - combinations of God's love
for us, ours for God, ours for one another. While all these are biblically valid points, which
did John mean here? Tom is convinced that John's primary focus here is on God's love for us:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This entire section focuses mainly on God's love, from vv7-16, repeatedly.</li>
<li>All the paragraphs in this text follow a similar pattern: moving from God's love for us to a

<li>This passage is intended to give us confidence for the Day of Judgment. Nothing in you or me
can give us that confidence, but rather the perfect, saving love of God alone.</li>

<div class="outline-text-9" id="text-org9454f1b">
<p>
'perfected', 'perfect love', 'perfected in love' - 'perfect' here is not 'flawless', as
only God has that kind of love; but rather 'wholeness', love that has reached its maturity,
marked by confidence in the face of judgment.
</p>

<p>
How does the Spirit mature our understanding of God's love, then? Not by means outside the
Scripture, but rather in and through Scripture. As you grow in understanding of God's Word,
you grow in confidence that you will stand on the day of judgment. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Ephesians 3:14-19" target="_blank">Ephesians 3:14-19</a>

<div class="outline-text-9" id="text-orgd9867f8">
<p>
'confidence' - 'boldness' or 'assurance', a word John loves to use.
</p>

<p>
This leads to confidence in prayer, at His second coming, and at the Judgment.
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:28; 3:21; 5:14" target="_blank">2:28; 3:21; 5:14</a> We can dare boldly to stand before God; He who we should dread because of

<div class="outline-text-9" id="text-org3d9174a">
<p>
As Jesus is right now in Heaven, we are right now in this world. What is the point of
similarity? We share His position as a loved and favored Son. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Matthew 3:17" target="_blank">Matthew 3:17</a> Likewise,
because of who Christ is, and because we stand in Him, God now points to us in the same way
and states, 'this is a son of mine'. We are sons in and through the Son, the objects of
God's love and favor as He is.
</p>

<p>
So, as Christ calls God Father and stands with confidence before Him, we may enjoy that
same privilege.

<div class="outline-text-10" id="text-org50896c5">
<p>
The kind of fear - dread or terror, or reverence and respect and godly fear - is based on
context. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Exodus 20:20" target="_blank">Exodus 20:20</a> shows these two fears contrasted clearly. Here, we do not have a
dread or terror of judgment, while our reverential fear is preserved. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 Peter 1:17" target="_blank">1 Peter 1:17</a>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 8:15" target="_blank">Romans 8:15</a> You can't approach God boldly in love and hide from Him in terror at the same
time. If we are afraid God is going to punish us, we cannot be fully aware of His love for
us.
</p>

<p>
'cast out' - 'to throw somebody out'; a mature understanding of God's love for us engages
in mortal combat with fear of judgment, and casts it out of the heart again and again.

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Matthew 25:46" target="_blank">Matthew 25:46</a> This is fear of the punishment Christ will deal on the day of judgment.
When we disobey God, it produces legal guilt before God; this is followed by an <i>internal</i>
sense of guilt, which produces fear of judgment and punishment. Every soul is destined for
eternal life, or eternal punishment. If you have not repented and believed in Christ Jesus
Jesus, <i>your worst fears are true</i>, and the verdict has already been made; the judgment is
just the formal sentencing. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 2:6" target="_blank">Romans 2:6</a> This will be based on your sins, and for the
opportunities to repent that you have rejected after having heard the Gospel.

<p>
It is appointed to man once to die, and then comes the Judgment. You will receive exactly
what you deserve for your sins and for trampling the sacrifice of Christ underfoot.
<i>Respond</i> to the love of God shown in the Gospel when He made His Son the propitiation
for your sin, granting to you access to perfect forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
If you have already repented and set your faith on Christ, there is <i>no longer any fear of
God's judgment</i>; we can have permanent confidence regarding our standing before God.

Lit. 'we are loving' - a continual pattern of life.

<p>
The parallel implies this is our love for God, and the following verse's contrast also
implies it. So 'we ourselves are loving God, because He Himself first loved us.'
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">

<li>Our love for God is therefore a response to God's love; commensurate with and growing in
proportion to our understanding of God's love for us.</li>
<li>Our love for God is solely the product of what God has done in us. He gave us faith to
believe, and to continue to believe; and the Spirit grows our response of love.
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Galatians 5:22" target="_blank">Galatians 5:22</a></li>
<li>Our love for God is the inevitable result of His love for us. This - not some profession
of faith from your distant past - is a valid test of His love for us.</li>

If your life is marked by selfish pursuits, and hatred of God (seen in lack of love for
God), you have already broken the two greatest commandments of God, and it will not go well
for you at the judgment. Yet Christ extends His gracious invitation to abandon the lie that
you have believed about yourself, that 'everything is fine between me and God'. In God's
grace, He is showing you what is true so that you may repent and believe in His Son, He Who
He sent to perfectly display His love; He who perfectly loved God and others every moment
of His life, and who died an obedient death on the cross to pay for our breaking of those
very same commandments, and who was raised by the Father to show His acceptance of that
sacrifice as propitiation for our sin.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge5c73be">
<p>
There are kinds of faith - even 'attached' to the Christian faith - that do not save. To name
some:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Natural 'faith': the ordinary trust you put in natural law and calculations of risk.</li>
<li>Historical 'faith': Intellectual assent to the historical verity of Scripture, without
believing in its spiritual reality. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=James 2:19" target="_blank">James 2:19</a></li>
<li>Miraculous 'faith': Belief solely based on miracles done to or by them. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 2:23-25" target="_blank">John 2:23-25</a></li>
<li>Temporary 'faith': An initial eagerly emotional response to the gospel that is not genuine, and
does not endure.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Only one kind of faith is saving faith: supernatural faith, which God gives at your spiritual
rebirth. John expounds here on the nature of this saving faith.

<p>
240 occurrences of this word in its verb and noun forms in the NT; central to it.
</p>

<p>
Faith consists of three inseparable components:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Knowledge about the object of your belief; not a blind leap</li>
<li>Assent, internally convinced of the truthfulness of that knowledge; this includes
acknowledging your own need</li>
<li>Trust in the object of your belief; acting on the knowledge to which you have assented in
total dependent trust</li>
</ul>

<p>
This faith is trust in the person of Christ, placing all our hope on Him alone for our
salvation, rejecting ourselves utterly as contributing only our own damnation.
</p>

<p>
John Murray - 'Faith is the whole-souled act of loving trust and self-commitment.'
</p>

<p>
John MacArthur - 'Saving faith is a fundamental commitment of the whole person to the whole
Christ.'

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org57828d7">
<p>
The Jesus Christ of history is the promised Messiah to Israel, He who would live a righteous
life and die a death of substitutionary atonement; the eternal Son of God made flesh, who
died, was buried, rose again, and ascended to Heaven; and who will return one day to reign and
destroy His enemies and the reign and presence of sin once and for all.
</p>

<p>
This cannot be believed out of our own power; you are not smarter or better than the rest of
the people on this planet because <i>you</i> conjured the faith out of your own power! Rather, it
is entirely given to us by God as His gracious gift. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Philippians 1:29" target="_blank">Philippians 1:29</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Acts 16:14; 18:27" target="_blank">Acts 16:14; 18:27</a>

<li><a id="org35459e0"></a>B. A Definition of a True Christian<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org35459e0">
<p>
Lit. 'is born out of God'; i.e. 'is a true Christian', by our Lord's own words regarding the
'new birth'; also called 'regeneration'. This is the sovereign act of God by the Holy Spirit
through the preached Gospel whereby He instantaneously breathes new life into a sinner in a
moment in time, making one who was spiritually dead to now be alive.
</p>

<p>
The mark of a true Christian is not <i>what we have done</i>, it is what God has done <i>to us</i>. It is
a transformation of being, totally different than who one was before. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=2 Corinthians 5:17" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 5:17</a> They
know they are different than they were before, and different from those around them who are
not saved. This changed nature should be evident to the believer, and indeed that is part of
the reason for John's writing of this book.
</p>

<p>
Note that a Christian is <i>not</i> someone who just tries to live a better life or to follow the
ethics of Jesus, but one whom God has given new life.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="orge6031de"></a>C. The Role of the New Birth<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orge6031de">
<p>
What is the relationship between faith and regeneration? John gives us some insight into the
'ordo saludis' - the 'order of salvation', the chronological order and logical/causal order of
the events that occur in salvation. At the moment of salvation, six separate events happen to
you at a single point in time.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The Effectual Call: God calls you to Himself</li>
<li>Regeneration: New life, the new birth</li>
<li>Giving of Repentance and Faith</li>
<li>Justification: Declared judicially right with God, crediting your sins to Christ and His
righteousness to you</li>
<li>Positional (or Definitive) Sanctification: God setting you apart to Himself</li>
<li>Adoption: God adopting you as His own child</li>
</ol>

<p>
Faith comes before and is the logical cause of Justification, for example, since we are
'justified by faith'.
</p>

<p>
So what is the causal order between faith and the new birth? 'believing' is in the present
tense, and 'born' is in the perfect tense, i.e. it has been completed in the past. John uses
this construction in two other places to describe such causal relationships. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:29" target="_blank">2:29</a>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Ezekiel 36:27" target="_blank">cf. Ezekiel 36:27</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 4:7" target="_blank">4:7</a>
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 1:12-13" target="_blank">John 1:12-13</a> Lit. 'The ones who are believing: these are the ones who, having been born, [&#x2026;]'
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 3:3" target="_blank">John 3:3</a>
</p>

<p>
Apart from Christ, our moral inability means we can't even <i>understand</i> the gospel! We can't
obey God or please Him; and we cannot come to Christ for salvation. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 Corinthians 2:14" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 8:7-8" target="_blank">Romans 8:7-8</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 6:44" target="_blank">John 6:44</a>
</p>

<p>
So our faith is being described as being a <i>consequence</i> of the new birth: He makes us a new
creature capable of faith, and then we believe. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Ephesians 2:1-5" target="_blank">Ephesians 2:1-5</a> Without regeneration, it is
morally and spiritually impossible for a person to believe in Christ; but in regeneration, it
is morally and spiritually impossible for a person <i>not</i> to believe in Christ. We are born
again by God in order to believe.
</p>

<p>
&#x2026; So why does this matter? It is, in fact, <i>crucial</i>.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="org2fb9277"></a>1. It destroys our pride and produces humility and gratitude.<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org2fb9277">
<p>
Understanding that we could never have responded on our own, as we were dead men incapable of
response, we know that we have endless gratitude toward God, because He alone could have given
us life unto faith.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org1aeb849"></a>2. It shapes our understanding of the entire doctrine of salvation.<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org1aeb849">
<p>
Our understanding of the reality of salvation exists, and is either more or less accurate to
what is actually true. An incorrect understanding of the order of salvation inevitably
produces a system by which <i>man</i> is the center of salvation, not God and not Christ.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org10979c7"></a>3. It affects our approach to evangelism.<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org10979c7">
<p>
If you believe man is initiator of salvation, you will focus your efforts on persuading,
encouraging, cajoling, convincing, and even manipulating people to believe; and you will
ultimately use <i>any</i> technique to provoke that outward response of 'faith'.
</p>

<p>
Consider the invitation or altar call, twenty rounds of 'Just As I Am', popularized by Charles
Finney, who claimed that man was predisposed to accept the gospel and only needed to be
manipulated emotionally into coming to that decision. Similar tactics are used today by
churches teaching a false gospel.
</p>

<p>
But if you believe God alone gives new birth through the teaching of His Word, then you'll
teach the Word and leave the work in the heart to the Holy Spirit.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org971ac47"></a>4. It strengthens our peace and assurance.<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org971ac47">
<p>
If I'm not responsible for my salvation, but God wholly is, what assurance! I don't have to
worry that I did not do enough, because God is wholly able.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="orgc571d8a"></a>5. It provides our hope of perseverance and ultimate glorification.<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgc571d8a">
<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Philippians 1:6" target="_blank">Philippians 1:6</a> Since God begins the work of salvation, and not ourselves, we can be certain
He will complete that same work. We didn't start it, and we can't end it prematurely.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org5203b5e"></a>6. If you've never been born of God, it reduces you to a spiritual beggar, pleading with God for His grace.<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org5203b5e">
<p>
Since you cannot initiate salvation of your own will, you must come to God and plead before
Him. All believers are those who have come as beggars before God, pleading with Him to save
them from their piteous state. We have nothing God wants, and we cannot earn His favor; we can
but ask Him to give grace.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="org15790ae"></a>7. It gives God ultimate glory.<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org15790ae">
<p>
We take no part of the credit or the glory for salvation on ourselves. No humility, no
ostensible righteous living, not even a sliver of the last mile in salvation is ours. God is
responsible for the whole, and He deserves all the glory, and we <i>must</i> give Him all the
glory for His rescue of us! <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 Corinthians 1:26-31" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 1:26-31</a>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgde8e1b0">
<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=James 2:14-26" target="_blank">James 2:14-26</a> speaks of two kinds of faith in the church: real, living faith that saves; and
deceiving, dead faith that damns. Both claim to be and are convinced they are christians; they
embrace the same doctrine, claim the same Jesus and the same gospel; and both are present in
every church, from James' day to this.
</p>

<p>
How do you identify it? <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=James 2:26" target="_blank">James 2:26</a> tells us that it is known by the fruits which real, living,
saving faith produces!
</p>

<p>
These results are guaranteed in the life of someone who has been born of God. Here, John brings
all three of the tests together, showing their unity and coherence one with another.

produces love for God; there are no exceptions.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org1115ca3">
<p>
This doesn't come easily or naturally to the flesh; and it can even be a challenge.
</p>

<p>
Lit. 'everyone who loves the One who begats loves also the one who He has begotten' - this is
not speaking of Jesus, though that love is certainly a prerequisite; but John is here speaking
about your fellow christians who, like us, have been born of God. It is impossible to love God
without loving His children. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:10-11; 3:14; 4:20-21" target="_blank">2:10-11; 3:14; 4:20-21</a>
</p>

<p>
True christians love other christians because we see in them the same disposition as ourselves:
we and they owe all to the grace of God; God sent Jesus to die for us and them alike; and we
identify them as our spiritual siblings. We don't love them because we find them inherently
likeable, but because we share the same Father, the same Lord, and the same redemption.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orga0af63c">
<p>
Loving God and loving our brothers and sisters in Christ each confirm one another: both must be
present and in union. Both must be present in the christian life.
</p>

<p>
Deliberate and consistent active obedience to God's moral law show us that we indeed have
genuine faith. Genuine love for God expresses itself in obedience. So how does loving God and
keeping His commandments prove that we love other christians? Because God's commands are summed
up in those very things: 'Love God, and love your neighbor as your self.' <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 13:8-10" target="_blank">Romans 13:8-10</a>
</p>

<p>
'For this <i>is</i> the love of God, that we keep His commandments' - the two are so connected, that
loving God is <i>defined</i> here as keeping His commandments: it is the way in which we love God!
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=2 John 6" target="_blank">2 John 6</a> Our love for God causes us to desire to please Him. "If we judge our love for God
purely at the emotional level without regard to the moral obedience which God's law demands, we
might find ourselves excusing disobedience. [&#x2026;] This would cause us to find God's laws a
bore, a chore, burdensome."
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Deuteronomy 5:10; 7:9; 10:12-13" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 5:10; 7:9; 10:12-13</a> God continually couples these things, and reminds us that His
commands are always for our good! <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=John 14:15" target="_blank">John 14:15</a> Christ Himself reaffirmed this - He did not break
the commandments, but fulfilled them. Biblical love is always profoundly <i>practical</i>, and love
for God is expressed <i>practically</i> in obedience. We know God's will for us, His command for us,
by the revelation of His will that He has given to us in His Word.
</p>

<p>
Before we were born of God, we saw His commandments as burdensome, restrictive, denying us
happiness and joy; but having been saved and adopted by Him, we see His commandments aright as
worthy of being treasured most highly, valued beyond measure, savored as the sweetest delight.
His commands are not a crushing, exhausting burden; but in Christ, they are life-giving, meant
for our well-being. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 7:22; 12:2" target="_blank">Romans 7:22; 12:2</a>

'cosmos' - 'order' or 'arrangement', an ordered system as opposed to chaos. It is used of the
universe, life (men and creatures), mankind, fallen humanity, and - as in this passage - to an
organized system created by Satan to enslave humanity and which is alien and hostile to God.
</p>

<p>
All things opposed to the spiritual kingdom of Christ constitute 'the world'. Chaos, conflict,
and confusion are the symptoms, but it is orchestrated and planned by a conspiracy of one:
Satan, fueled by his hatred of God and God's people. He crafts worldviews and religions and
ideas that are intended to lead people away from God and into damning error. Self-
gratification, self-fulfillment, and self-promotion are the triad of temptation that are the
hallmarks of all his lies.

We once loved the world and its lusts; but now we love God. We once loved our sin; now,
righteousness. In the new birth, we have overturned the old system under which we were

Monasticism - isolation and withdrawal from the world - is not a right means. Nor is legalism:
forbidding actions and behaviours that are not forbidden in Scripture, simply because they are
popular in the world. 'The flesh has no power to control the flesh.' Asceticism - inflicting
suffering on your body to try and prevent enjoyment of the world - is also not right means.

believe in any other than Jesus - or any 'Jesus' that is not the Jesus of truth and history is

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org1b4445e">
<p>
This is not a Jesus of our own making or perspective; rather He is the Son of God. Believers
do not believe merely in God - other monotheistic faiths believe in a singular god - but we
believe in particular in Jesus Christ, consubstantial and coequal with the Father, the
God-Man - God incarnate.
</p>

<p>
'who came' - 'the coming One', Messiah; except now He has already come!
</p>

<p>
'Jesus Christ' - again, 'Jesus, the anointed one' or 'Jesus, Messiah'; He who would come to
redeem man from sin.
</p>

<p>
'by water and [by] blood' - three primary interpretations:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The water and blood that flowed from Jesus' side after He was pierced with a spear at the
crucifixion (held by Augustine, but unlikely, given the qualification John makes in the
latter half of this verse)</li>
<li>The two ordinances of the church: the water of baptism and the blood of the Lord's Table
(held by the Reformers; unlikely, as this is referring to concrete events in our Lord's
life, and the Lord's Table is never referred to as 'the blood' elsewhere)</li>
<li>Two key events in Jesus' earthly ministry: His baptism and death (Tertullian, and makes the
most sense in context and in the framing of what John is now speaking)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Jesus came to accomplish the redemption of His people, inaugurated for this purpose at
baptism, and completing it by bringing it to its consummation at His death and resurrection.
</p>

<p>
These two events confront the false teaching in these churches at Asia Minor: the Cerinthian
gnosticism ravaging the churches in that age, which taught Jesus was merely human, and that
the divine spirit of Messiah descended on Him at baptism and departed Him just before His
crucifixion, meaning it was merely a man that died. But we believe He came to earth as an
incarnate man in the womb of Mary, and continues to be the God-Man into eternity future,
having taken to Himself full human nature, adding it to His divine nature - and this includes
His death and resurrection. This Jesus is the object of our faith.
</p>

<p>
What did the Cerinthians believe? This was merely a gifted man and teacher; but not God, and
certainly incapable of saving mankind. To them, Jesus serves merely as a 'helpful guide'. And
this is what the vast majority of people believe who hear of Him, and even the majority of
churches and professing believers in the U.S. But He is not merely that, but the only way of
salvation by which any man may be saved.

<div class="outline-text-8" id="text-org0209d6a">
<p>
None of the early church fathers quote the first part of this verse; it's only present in
four late manuscripts. Erasmus - the Roman Catholic scholar - excluded this from the first
two editions of his Greek NT; under pressure, he agreed to include it if they could find a
Greek manuscript including it. They found one&#x2026; written that very year. So the added
section appearing in the footnotes can be safely rejected as being part of the original
text.
</p>

<p>
John points to three witnesses that continually testify to the truth regarding God's Son,
referring to the biblical standard of requiring two to three witnesses at minimum to
authenticate testimony.
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Genesis 3:15" target="_blank">Genesis 3:15</a> opens the first prophecy regarding the Messiah who would come to deal with sin.
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Isaiah 53" target="_blank">Isaiah 53</a> speaks of the mission of the Messiah and the means by which He would accomplish
it: He would be sacrificed, becoming the perfect guilt offering for His people.
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Mark 1:4" target="_blank">Mark 1:4</a> shows John the Baptist, he who came before the Messiah to prepare the way for Him,
baptizing those who demonstrated repentance for their sin: proselyte baptism, but not for
Gentiles, but for the Jews! "You are no closer to the kingdom than the Gentiles; if you want
to be part of the true Israel, you too need proselyte baptism."
</p>

<p>
In light of this, Jesus' proselyte baptism - having to do with sin, repentance and
forgiveness - is shocking. Yet it was not for His own sin, as He was perfect; but rather, He
identified Himself with sinners, those whose sins He would eventually bear. This is the
testimony of 'the water'.
</p>

<p>
The testimony of 'the blood' is the testimony of Jesus' death. The OT prophesied that the
Messiah would suffer, die, and be raised for the redemption of His people.
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Isaiah 53" target="_blank">Isaiah 53</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Luke 24:44-48" target="_blank">Luke 24:44-48</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Acts 17:1-3" target="_blank">Acts 17:1-3</a> This event of His death, therefore, testify to His being
the rightful Messiah.
</p>

<p>
'And the three are in agreement.' - These three witnesses all affirm the same thing, and are
in perfect agreement, satisfying the measure of evidence God Himself required.

<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-orgb9a017c">
<p>
God Himself testifies to Jesus' identity; it's not merely humans that testify, but God
Himself who testifies regarding His own Son. He is on the record in the New Testament
stating that Jesus of Nazareth is His eternal Son.

This is like the difference between believing <i>that</i> an airplane can fly and is safe; and

To do otherwise is to reject God's own testimony concerning Jesus, effectively calling God a
liar: an attack and assault on your Creator and Sustainer. Unbelief is a sin to be deplored,
not merely a mistake to be pitied.
</p>

God, sent by God. I am under the wrath of God: I am a doomed, guilty, foul sinner; and there

<p>
It is possible to have a false assurance of salvation: self-deception. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Matthew 7:21-23" target="_blank">Matthew 7:21-23</a> The true

It is also possible for genuine christians to have very weak assurance of salvation.

<p>
Assurance is crucial for our spiritual growth. "But who can tell how joyful this man was when
he had gotten his roll again? For this roll was the assurance of his life and acceptance at the
desired haven? O, how nimbly now did he go up the rest of the hill." - John Bunyan, <i>Pilgrim's

<i>Biblical Doctrines</i>: "The divinely-given confidence of the believer that he or she is truly

Many downplay or reject the concept of assurance; including Roman Catholics, Arminians (can

</p>

<p>
John Stott: "It is common today to dismiss any claims to assurance of salvation as
presumptuous, and to affirm that no certainty is possible this side of death; but certainty
and humility do not exclude one another. If God's revealed purpose is not only that we should
hear, believe, and live - but also that we should <i>know</i> - presumtuousness lies in <i>doubting</i>

Lit. word order in the Greek: "These things I wrote to you in order that you may know that
life you are having eternal to the ones believing into the name of the Son of God." - John
clarifies the qualifications for his audience.
</p>

<p>
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 2:19,24" target="_blank">2:19,24</a> A profession of faith in the biblical gospel and biblical Jesus in the past is

The youngest Christian understands their sins are forgiven by God through Christ. But John is
writing to those who believe to give them assurance that they must be lacking, in part
hampered by the false claims of the gnostics.
</p>

<p>
What are some things that can cloud our vision and erode our assurance?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Temptation, unrepentant sin, and sinful habits ("Would any real Christian have&#x2026;?")</li>
<li>Neglect of the spiritual disciplines, especially the reading of God's Word and prayer</li>
<li>Ignorance of or failure to personally apply the doctrine of justification <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 3-8" target="_blank">Romans 3-8</a></li>
<li>Feelings of guilt about past sins</li>
<li>Uncertainty about the timing of one's conversion, or having been saved as a child</li>
<li>The influence of other professing Christians (both by comparison with great saints who came
before, or by unsettling false teachings)</li>
<li>Physical exhaustion or illness</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
God also <i>commands</i> us to pursue assurance; it's not optional. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=2 Corinthians 13:5" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 13:5</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=2 Peter 1:10" target="_blank">2 Peter 1:10</a>

Grk. 'oida' - expresses knowledge characterized by assurance, something known with certainty.
e.g. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 8:28" target="_blank">Romans 8:28</a> This is in direct contrast to what you <i>feel</i> - this is not based on your
emotions, a terrible way to measure your assurance of salvation.

follow that of which you are certain, not the other way around.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org5ab37ca">
<p>
What are <i>wrong means</i> to seek assurance?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Religious ritual (e.g. the Catholic sacraments; in a prior baptism)</li>
<li>In assurance itself ("I just know I'm a Christian"; empty circular reasoning
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Deuteronomy 29:19" target="_blank">Deuteronomy 29:19</a>)</li>
<li>In the testimony of others ("I just know you're a Christian", often cited by family and
well-meaning parents)</li>
<li>In your own experiences ("I had a vision of Jesus," "I had a near-death experience," "I
prayed the sinner's prayer/walked an aisle/etc.")</li>
</ul>

<p>
What are the <i>right means</i> to seek assurance? The contents of the entire letter, most likely,
given John uses this structure to refer to his reason for writing his Gospel record, as well.
<a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 1:4" target="_blank">1:4</a> - 'is writing', and now 'has written': these statements bracket the entire letter in a

our will to whatever He deems is best.

confidence that He will do it. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Ephesians 3:14ff" target="_blank">Ephesians 3:14ff</a> For sanctification of the believer; that
His name be hallowed; that He will meet your daily needs; that He will forgive your sins;

confidence. Pray that you will become daily more like Christ, to daily love Him more, to
break the power of sin in our lives, and so much more that God has granted all who are His.
</p>

<p>
Prayer is not an attempt to get God to see things <i>my</i> way, to extract from Him something I
need or want; but rather, it is God's way for us to see things <i>His</i> way, to seek from Him
that which He desires for us.

Knowing this, go through the Bible and make a list of God's promises to you, and take those
to God, pleading them in His presence, and you may be certain that God grants it to you in
full. He will withhold from you nothing He has already purchased for you and desires for you
to have out of His love for you.

God responds to the prayer for this person by giving them life (Grk. 'zoe', eternal life),
implying they did not have eternal life before.

The theme of this paragraph as a whole is not about a believer's sins, but about what they
believe vs. the error of what the world believes: real vs. false christianity.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org8a69b94">
<p>
We are to pray for God to remove their spiritual blindness, praying for their salvation, and
going to them and pleading for them to turn, 'snatching them from the fire'.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgb9345ff">
<p>
Pray to God for their salvation, and God will save them - not an ironclad promise God will
save every unbeliever we pray for <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Romans 9" target="_blank">Romans 9</a>, but rather that He hears your prayer, and the God
who delights to save will save those He has chosen from eternity past <i>in answer to your
prayer</i>.
</p>

<p>
We are to pray for these, and to <i>persist</i> in prayer. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 Timothy 1:13-16" target="_blank">1 Timothy 1:13-16</a>

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgf125b1b">
<p>
Pray for the individuals who have been deceived, not for those doing the deceiving: those who
separate themselves from the true church, rejecting and perverting the gospel. These ones'
doom is sure. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=2 Peter 2:3b,9,17" target="_blank">2 Peter 2:3b,9,17</a> <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=Jude 13" target="_blank">Jude 13</a>
</p>

<p>
We don't know whom God has chosen; this isn't an absolute command, and we can pray for their
salvation. But such prayers may likely not be effective, as God has already consigned many
such ones to the darkness.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org2e83a83">
<p>
'no one' - about individuals; without exception.
</p>

<p>
'who has experienced the new birth' - This is not a passing change, but a permanent,
fundamental one.
</p>

<p>
'is sinning' - as seen before when John used this term: this does not refer to a state of
sinless perfection. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 1:8-10; 2:1" target="_blank">1:8-10; 2:1</a> We still have a sin nature and commit acts of sin, and we are
to live in a pattern of confession of and repentance over our sin, and to be in a continual
war against our sin. Ongoing, unrepentant sin is not, however, a lifelong pattern any more.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-orgf5dba7c">
<p>
'He who was begotten of God keeps him' - the verb tense changes; not 'the one having been
born', used to refer to Christians, but 'the one born', referring to a continual state of
being, the eternal Sonship of Christ. <a class="bible" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=LSB;ESV&search=1 John 4:9" target="_blank">1 John 4:9</a>
</p>

<p>
'keeps' - 'holding onto something, so as not to give it up or lose it'; He continually holds
on to, protects, and preserves every believer. While Christians are called to persevere in our
faith, but the ultimate reason Christians do not live in patterns of ongoing unrepentant sin
is because Christ protects them.

<p>
'the evil one' - Satan governs this world; this world's freedom is slavery, and his promise of
autonomy from God is an illusion. If you are not under the control of God, you are under the
control of Satan, whether you are aware of it or not. He is the father of all unbelievers
('You are of your father, the devil'), and he gives his children his nature, enslaving them to
sin just as he already is. He implants in his children a desire to think like he thinks and to
rebel as he has rebeled. And he blinds unbelievers to the truths of the gospel.

family; and we love the things that mark this family, and hate those things that mark our old
family.

This adoption cannot be undone; our emancipation is permanent, as God will certainly keep us.

'This is' - what is 'this'? It could refer to the Father, given context and prior usage; it
could refer to Jesus, the nearest antecedent grammatically, and John has referred to Jesus as
the eternal life previously; or God generally, the God of Scripture, wrapping up all He has
discussed in a single referent. This seems likely.

Anyone who teaches anything else about God, Jesus, the Gospel, and Scripture than what Jesus
Himself taught is <i>false</i>, and their teaching puts your spiritual health in great peril! We
are to guard ourselves from listening to and believing such a one. Consider Roman Catholic
attacks on grace; the libertinism of licentiousness; God stripped of His supernatural nature;
overfamiliarity cloaking His supremacy; any and all of these pose great danger to us and to
those we disciple.
