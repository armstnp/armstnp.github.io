      Primrose follows the map she'd taken from her former master, Helgenish. In
      a bid to get people talking, she takes the stage of the local pub. As she
      performs, she's found by Arianna, a servant of House Azelhart while
      Primrose was a girl. She appears to be hiding something of her occupation
      and her knowledge of what the map points to. She takes her to her home,
      in actuality a world-renowned brothel, Stillsnow's secret. She reveals the
      map as pointing to the drop-off point for the brothel's customers, and
      Primrose plans to take the carriage back to the man with the crow-marked
      arm. She finds the driver impassable, but a word to the barkeep he's
      indebted to ensures her passage.
      As she rides, she recalls memories of her father, raising her to become
      the next head of House Azelheart, gifting her with a dagger with the house
      words, "Faith shall be your shield," - a reminder to choose her beliefs
      and faith wisely. The carriage takes her to the
      [[Road to the Obsidian Parlor (20)][Road to the Obsidian Parlor (20)]], a hub of human trafficking, where she
      enters the house through a [[Secret Path (21)][Secret Path (21)]].
      As she does, we see Father Eschard - a Bishop of the Flame - begging the
      Left-hand man - Rufus -  to help him take revenge on a house that had
      violated his daughter and left her to commit suicide. Rufus agrees, and
      offers one of his girls - Arianna - to his service.
      Primrose confronts Rufus with her identity, and he tells her her father
      had made too many enemies, and learned the wrong kinds of things. She, in
      turn, tells him of the one thing she believes in: Revenge.
      She fells him where he stands, and in his dying words he points her to her
      next destination: back home, to Noblecourt. As she departs, Arianna
      prompts her to tell what she believes in, and to her sorrow, Primrose
      reaffirms her commitment to vengeance.

      She finds them in the woods' depths, confronted with an enormous wolf. Her
      companions and she drove the wolf off, rescuing the boys and allowing them
      to reconcile, even finding the missing brooch. Returning to the temple,

***** DONE Olberic: Chapter 2                                       :Olberic:
      Olberic seeks sign of the traitor Erhardt in Victor's Hollow, where the
      brigand Gaston had told him of Gustav, the Black Knight who might be able
      to point his steps in the right direction. Gustav seems to be a hot new
      contender in the city's famed arena.
      
      A woman named Cecily notices Olberic, and offers to sponsor him in the
      arena, hoping he's the key to her big break, noting that that's his best
      bet to talk to Gustav. She offers a way to get him in even after the
      qualifying rounds: publicly provoke and defeat one of the qualified
      fighters. He seeks out and challenges a Contemptuous and a Prideful
      Warrior, drawing out Victorino, the Buccaneer's Bane: bounty hound.
      Olberic handily beats Victorino, and he honorably offers his place in the
      tournament. The whole town is abuzz with news of the swordsman of the
      fallen realm. 

      Introductions made, the tournament begins, with Gustav hinting that he
      will tell Olberic more upon his victory. He duels Joshua Frostblade, who
      fights for love; Archibold the Crusher, who fights for his father's
      memory; and Gustav, the Black Knight. He realizes he fights today for
      victory alone this day; and with that reason, he defeats Gustav, and is
      crowned the new king of the arena. Yet he still lacks a reason to carry
      his blade.

      Back at his inn room, Gustav tells Olberic of Erhardt, the spy he had
      always been since his hometown had been sacked, and how he blamed King
      Alfred of Hornburg for not coming to its defense. Both Olberic and Gustav
      comment on how proud they were to know him, despite his deeds. Gustav
      points Olberic in the direction of Wellspring to find Erhardt at last.
      Olberic muses on the reason Erhardt wielded his blade: vengeance. He
      wonders if he set the sword aside, now his vengeance was complete.

      On his way out of town, Cecily catches up to him and offers to make him
      a full-time champion if he ever returns. Olberic declines; it is not the
      life for him, and the road beckons him on to the Sunlands.
