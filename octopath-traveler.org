      Alfyn arrives at Goldshore, looking for any requiring his aid. He hears of
      a fellow apothecary in town, and decides to seek her out. On his way, he
      aids a young girl, Ellen, who had tripped and skinned her knee. She tells
      him of her sister, Flynn, down hard with a fever.

      On arriving at Flynn's house, he finds the child already cured, and
      a dismissive mother labeled him a fraud and threw him out. Alfyn admires
      this other apothecary's handiwork, and meandering north, finds her in the
      aristocratic quarters of the town, commenting that she did not require
      fees for her work, a sentiment that resonates with Alfyn. She introduces
      herself as Vanessa Hysel. But when Alfyn asks her about her tools and
      tricks, she suddenly clams up.

      Wandering on the beach, Alfyn meets Ellen again, and talks with her about
      what he finds truly valuable, and encourages her to treasure her family
      above all else. Returning to the northern end of the town, he witnesses
      an aristocrat asking Vanessa to attend to her ill husband. Vanessa
      identifies the illness as Gaborra whooping cough, and the cure as a moss
      from a distant and treacherous location. She proceeds to call for a steep
      fee for her cure, stunning all present. All in attendance see the health
      of their families as a priority, and are willing to pay her fee. Then
      Flynn's mother, Marlene, requests a cure in front of all the aristocrats,
      even knowing she has no money at all, much less enough for the cure.
      Vanessa spurns her, but not before observing her stock is almost out.
      Alfyn finds Marlene crying, and offers to try and treat Flynn.

      On examining the medicine Vanessa had used to treat Flynn, Alfyn
      recognizes the scent from the Gaborra evergreen - a proper treatment,
      but one also inducing the cough he now witnessed, resembling the namesake
      plague. Realizing the ploy Vanessa had used, he seeks word of the blue
      moss that can treat the side effects. He gleans word of Vanessa's
      destination from a coachman, and tales of Glowworm Moss from a local
      aristocrat, leading Alfyn to pinpoint her goal as the Caves of Azure to
      the east.

      In the depths of the caves, he finds Vanessa right where he'd expected.
      She speaks of how she views the people she treats - as mere tools to
      further her own enrichment. She is willing to use her skills to do harm
      rather than heal to that end. Alfyn confronts her, and she aims to silence
      him. The protection she purchased proves to be insufficient, though, as
      Alfyn brings her down, and uses a Slumberthorn to knock her out before she
      can escape. He gathers some moss, treats Flynn with it, and departs to
      continue his healing in Saintsbridge of the Riverlands.

      Primrose follows the map she'd taken from her former master, Helgenish. In
      a bid to get people talking, she takes the stage of the local pub. As she
      performs, she's found by Arianna, a servant of House Azelhart while
      Primrose was a girl. She appears to be hiding something of her occupation
      and her knowledge of what the map points to. She takes her to her home,
      in actuality a world-renowned brothel, Stillsnow's secret. She reveals the
      map as pointing to the drop-off point for the brothel's customers, and
      Primrose plans to take the carriage back to the man with the crow-marked
      arm. She finds the driver impassable, but a word to the barkeep he's
      indebted to ensures her passage.
      As she rides, she recalls memories of her father, raising her to become
      the next head of House Azelheart, gifting her with a dagger with the house
      words, "Faith shall be your shield," - a reminder to choose her beliefs
      and faith wisely. The carriage takes her to the
      [[Road to the Obsidian Parlor (20)][Road to the Obsidian Parlor (20)]], a hub of human trafficking, where she
      enters the house through a [[Secret Path (21)][Secret Path (21)]].
      As she does, we see Father Eschard - a Bishop of the Flame - begging the
      Left-hand man - Rufus -  to help him take revenge on a house that had
      violated his daughter and left her to commit suicide. Rufus agrees, and
      offers one of his girls - Arianna - to his service.
      Primrose confronts Rufus with her identity, and he tells her her father
      had made too many enemies, and learned the wrong kinds of things. She, in
      turn, tells him of the one thing she believes in: Revenge.
      She fells him where he stands, and in his dying words he points her to her
      next destination: back home, to Noblecourt. As she departs, Arianna
      prompts her to tell what she believes in, and to her sorrow, Primrose
      reaffirms her commitment to vengeance.

      H'annit comes to Stonegard in search of her master, Z'aanta, who had
      vanished in pursuit of the fiend Redeye. Following the trail left in his
      only letter, she brings his returned direwolf Hägen with her to Stonegard.

      She checks the alehouse first, where the tavern keeper knew him, but
      hadn't seen him in some time. He noted Z'aanta had been visiting a woman,
      Natalia, at the edge of town during his stay. He also recognized her from
      the hunter's descriptions. On exiting the alehouse, Hägen seems disturbed
      by something and runs, with Linde and H'annit pursuing.

      They catch the direwolf as he confronts a local bodyguard in his way,
      protecting an aristocrat - Nathan - greeting a woman named Natalia. Nearby
      townspeople remark on the aristocrat's character: a philanderer of no good
      account. H'aanig realizes Hägen was trying to come to Natalia's aid, and
      provokes the soldier with her own coterie of wild animals to disguise her
      role.

      The wanton man chased away, Natalia recognizes Hägen and wonders where
      he and Z'aanta had been, and why they had departed so suddenly. They head
      to Natalia's home where she tells H'annit that the last they had heard, he
      was heading into the nearby woods three months prior. Further prompting
      from H'annit revealed Natalia's husband had been a friend of Z'aanta
      before he passed, and hints that their relationship since then had become
      more than close. They part, and H'annit heads to the Spectrewood in the
      north.

      H'annit finds the path blocked by a rockfall, and this seems to be the
      place where Z'aanta and Hägen were separated. She finds a wildlife trail
      nearby, guarded by an Ancient One, which appears to be a living twisted
      tree. She provokes it, and gains entry to the Spectrewood. In its depths
      she confronts the Lord of the Forest, where she finds her master's arrows
      in the dirt. She wards off the beast, and delves still deeper into the
      woods. There, she finds Z'aanta, petrified as a stone statue, one of his
      arrows stuck into a nearby tree with a message for the one who found him.
      She reads it to discover Redeye is the cause of this petrification, and
      that Susanna of Stillsnow may know a cure for the condition.

      H'annit returns to Natalia to inform her of Z'aanta's plight, and promises
      to find a cure. Natalia observes the likeness between 'prentice and
      master: their common stubborn focus in the heat of the hunt. The two are
      interrupted by a knock at the door, and Linde growls in recognition as
      Natalia lets Eliza in. She is informed of the situation as well, and is
      unable to offer more information on the beast Redeye, as the Knights
      Ardante had only instructed her to hire the hunter. She now goes to hunt
      the beast herself, instructing H'annit to find the seer Susanna in the
      meanwhile.

      As H'annit departs from Stonegard, Natalia catches up to her and gives a
      parting gift of meager supplies, her own contribution to the effort for
      Z'aanta's sake. And so H'annit departed for Stillsnow and Susanna.

***** DONE Olberic: Chapter 2                                       :Olberic:
      Olberic seeks sign of the traitor Erhardt in Victor's Hollow, where the
      brigand Gaston had told him of Gustav, the Black Knight who might be able
      to point his steps in the right direction. Gustav seems to be a hot new
      contender in the city's famed arena.
      
      A woman named Cecily notices Olberic, and offers to sponsor him in the
      arena, hoping he's the key to her big break, noting that that's his best
      bet to talk to Gustav. She offers a way to get him in even after the
      qualifying rounds: publicly provoke and defeat one of the qualified
      fighters. He seeks out and challenges a Contemptuous and a Prideful
      Warrior, drawing out Victorino, the Buccaneer's Bane: bounty hound.
      Olberic handily beats Victorino, and he honorably offers his place in the
      tournament. The whole town is abuzz with news of the swordsman of the
      fallen realm. 

      Introductions made, the tournament begins, with Gustav hinting that he
      will tell Olberic more upon his victory. He duels Joshua Frostblade, who
      fights for love; Archibold the Crusher, who fights for his father's
      memory; and Gustav, the Black Knight. He realizes he fights today for
      victory alone this day; and with that reason, he defeats Gustav, and is
      crowned the new king of the arena. Yet he still lacks a reason to carry
      his blade.

      Back at his inn room, Gustav tells Olberic of Erhardt, the spy he had
      always been since his hometown had been sacked, and how he blamed King
      Alfred of Hornburg for not coming to its defense. Both Olberic and Gustav
      comment on how proud they were to know him, despite his deeds. Gustav
      points Olberic in the direction of Wellspring to find Erhardt at last.
      Olberic muses on the reason Erhardt wielded his blade: vengeance. He
      wonders if he set the sword aside, now his vengeance was complete.

      On his way out of town, Cecily catches up to him and offers to make him
      a full-time champion if he ever returns. Olberic declines; it is not the
      life for him, and the road beckons him on to the Sunlands.
