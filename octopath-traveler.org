      Alfyn arrives at Goldshore, looking for any requiring his aid. He hears of
      a fellow apothecary in town, and decides to seek her out. On his way, he
      aids a young girl, Ellen, who had tripped and skinned her knee. She tells
      him of her sister, Flynn, down hard with a fever.

      On arriving at Flynn's house, he finds the child already cured, and
      a dismissive mother labeled him a fraud and threw him out. Alfyn admires
      this other apothecary's handiwork, and meandering north, finds her in the
      aristocratic quarters of the town, commenting that she did not require
      fees for her work, a sentiment that resonates with Alfyn. She introduces
      herself as Vanessa Hysel. But when Alfyn asks her about her tools and
      tricks, she suddenly clams up.

      Wandering on the beach, Alfyn meets Ellen again, and talks with her about
      what he finds truly valuable, and encourages her to treasure her family
      above all else. Returning to the northern end of the town, he witnesses
      an aristocrat asking Vanessa to attend to her ill husband. Vanessa
      identifies the illness as Gaborra whooping cough, and the cure as a moss
      from a distant and treacherous location. She proceeds to call for a steep
      fee for her cure, stunning all present. All in attendance see the health
      of their families as a priority, and are willing to pay her fee. Then
      Flynn's mother, Marlene, requests a cure in front of all the aristocrats,
      even knowing she has no money at all, much less enough for the cure.
      Vanessa spurns her, but not before observing her stock is almost out.
      Alfyn finds Marlene crying, and offers to try and treat Flynn.

      On examining the medicine Vanessa had used to treat Flynn, Alfyn
      recognizes the scent from the Gaborra evergreen - a proper treatment,
      but one also inducing the cough he now witnessed, resembling the namesake
      plague. Realizing the ploy Vanessa had used, he seeks word of the blue
      moss that can treat the side effects. He gleans word of Vanessa's
      destination from a coachman, and tales of Glowworm Moss from a local
      aristocrat, leading Alfyn to pinpoint her goal as the Caves of Azure to
      the east.

      In the depths of the caves, he finds Vanessa right where he'd expected.
      She speaks of how she views the people she treats - as mere tools to
      further her own enrichment. She is willing to use her skills to do harm
      rather than heal to that end. Alfyn confronts her, and she aims to silence
      him. The protection she purchased proves to be insufficient, though, as
      Alfyn brings her down, and uses a Slumberthorn to knock her out before she
      can escape. He gathers some moss, treats Flynn with it, and departs to
      continue his healing in Saintsbridge of the Riverlands.

      Primrose follows the map she'd taken from her former master, Helgenish. In
      a bid to get people talking, she takes the stage of the local pub. As she
      performs, she's found by Arianna, a servant of House Azelhart while
      Primrose was a girl. She appears to be hiding something of her occupation
      and her knowledge of what the map points to. She takes her to her home,
      in actuality a world-renowned brothel, Stillsnow's secret. She reveals the
      map as pointing to the drop-off point for the brothel's customers, and
      Primrose plans to take the carriage back to the man with the crow-marked
      arm. She finds the driver impassable, but a word to the barkeep he's
      indebted to ensures her passage.
      As she rides, she recalls memories of her father, raising her to become
      the next head of House Azelheart, gifting her with a dagger with the house
      words, "Faith shall be your shield," - a reminder to choose her beliefs
      and faith wisely. The carriage takes her to the
      [[Road to the Obsidian Parlor (20)][Road to the Obsidian Parlor (20)]], a hub of human trafficking, where she
      enters the house through a [[Secret Path (21)][Secret Path (21)]].
      As she does, we see Father Eschard - a Bishop of the Flame - begging the
      Left-hand man - Rufus -  to help him take revenge on a house that had
      violated his daughter and left her to commit suicide. Rufus agrees, and
      offers one of his girls - Arianna - to his service.
      Primrose confronts Rufus with her identity, and he tells her her father
      had made too many enemies, and learned the wrong kinds of things. She, in
      turn, tells him of the one thing she believes in: Revenge.
      She fells him where he stands, and in his dying words he points her to her
      next destination: back home, to Noblecourt. As she departs, Arianna
      prompts her to tell what she believes in, and to her sorrow, Primrose
      reaffirms her commitment to vengeance.
***** DONE H'annit: Chapter 3                                        :Haanit:
      H'annit comes to Stillsnow to seek out the seer Susanna. Linde begins to
      frolic in the snow, surprising H'annit somewhat before realizing the snow
      leopard feels at home there. Some children notice Linde and begin to pet
      them; H'annit begins her search by asking them where Susanna is to be
      found. They refer to her as the 'witch', and direct H'annit to her abode.
      
      A crowd greets her in front of the red-roofed house, a wayfarer in dispute
      about being turned away, as he'd sought the telling of his fortune from the
      seer. When the man he's shouting at does not respond or step aside, he
      attempts to assault him, only to find himself shoved to the ground. Another
      villager names the silent man Alaic, noting he does not talk at all, as
      Susanna talks for both. Alaic appears to be a minder of sorts for the
      seer's business. Despite her famed talent, Susanna does not allow anyone to
      visit her. H'annit provokes Alaic, drawing him into a scuffle with Linde,
      who topples him.

      As Alaic falls, dazed, Susanna emerges from the house, cackling and bidding
      H'annit and Linde by name to help carry Alaic inside, while dropping hints
      that she knows quite a bit about them, and that her legendary skill as a
      seer is nothing more than simple deduction. Inside, Susanna speaks of one
      possible cure for the curse, and also observes that Z'aanta had raised a
      fine 'prentice. The cure, she reveals, is to slay the beast that had
      wrought the curse in the first place; this would first require H'annit to
      seek a defense from Redeye's power in the first place, a plant named herb-
      of-grace, growing in the Whitewood. Alaic meets them at the wood's edge,
      bidding them take care so they could continue to bring Susanna the joy
      she'd shown when they'd arrived.

      Deep in the wood, she finds the herb in a clearing; but the roar of a
      dragon interrupts her approach, and she realizes she's walked right into
      its lair. She recalls Z'aanta's tales - some seeming taller than most - and
      his admonition to keep hold of all the stories she can of her own battles.
      Indeed, he promised her that should no other man believe her tales, he
      would believe every word. Now, H'annit plans to make him eat those words
      with this particular tale.

      With the dragon slain, the monsters return: their tyrant's reign is ended.
      H'annit gathers the herb-of-grace and leaves the wood while the monsters
      are still calm. Alaic still stands at the woods' edge, feigning ambivalence
      while still harboring clear concern for the huntress. They return to town,
      where Susanna brews the herbs in preparation, and asks them to recount the
      tale of the fight. She admires the huntress' story-telling, recalling how
      she had had to teach Z'aanta what skill he had. The brew completes, and
      Susanna hands H'annit ten doses, bidding her drink when the curse begins to
      settle.

      On her way out of town, one of the Knights Ardante greets her. Lady Eliza
      has spotted Redeye near Marsalim in the Sunlands. Susanna and Alaic bid her
      farewell, and she departs, too naive to notice Alaic's affection.

      hadn't seen him in some time. He noted Z'aanta had been visiting a woman,
      Natalia, at the edge of town during his stay. He also recognized her from
      the hunter's descriptions. On exiting the alehouse, Hägen seems disturbed
      by something and runs, with Linde and H'annit pursuing.

      They catch the direwolf as he confronts a local bodyguard in his way,
      protecting an aristocrat - Nathan - greeting a woman named Natalia. Nearby
      townspeople remark on the aristocrat's character: a philanderer of no good
      account. H'aanig realizes Hägen was trying to come to Natalia's aid, and
      provokes the soldier with her own coterie of wild animals to disguise her
      role.

      The wanton man chased away, Natalia recognizes Hägen and wonders where
      he and Z'aanta had been, and why they had departed so suddenly. They head
      to Natalia's home where she tells H'annit that the last they had heard, he
      was heading into the nearby woods three months prior. Further prompting
      from H'annit revealed Natalia's husband had been a friend of Z'aanta
      before he passed, and hints that their relationship since then had become
      more than close. They part, and H'annit heads to the Spectrewood in the
      north.

      H'annit finds the path blocked by a rockfall, and this seems to be the
      place where Z'aanta and Hägen were separated. She finds a wildlife trail
      nearby, guarded by an Ancient One, which appears to be a living twisted
      tree. She provokes it, and gains entry to the Spectrewood. In its depths
      she confronts the Lord of the Forest, where she finds her master's arrows
      in the dirt. She wards off the beast, and delves still deeper into the
      woods. There, she finds Z'aanta, petrified as a stone statue, one of his
      arrows stuck into a nearby tree with a message for the one who found him.
      She reads it to discover Redeye is the cause of this petrification, and
      that Susanna of Stillsnow may know a cure for the condition.

      H'annit returns to Natalia to inform her of Z'aanta's plight, and promises
      to find a cure. Natalia observes the likeness between 'prentice and
      master: their common stubborn focus in the heat of the hunt. The two are
      interrupted by a knock at the door, and Linde growls in recognition as
      Natalia lets Eliza in. She is informed of the situation as well, and is
      unable to offer more information on the beast Redeye, as the Knights
      Ardante had only instructed her to hire the hunter. She now goes to hunt
      the beast herself, instructing H'annit to find the seer Susanna in the
      meanwhile.

      As H'annit departs from Stonegard, Natalia catches up to her and gives a
      parting gift of meager supplies, her own contribution to the effort for
      Z'aanta's sake. And so H'annit departed for Stillsnow and Susanna.

***** DONE Alfyn: Chapter III                                         :Alfyn:
      A man named Miguel crouches wounded beside a cabin, injured and begging
      for food. An unknown apothecary inspects the wound, finding it festered,
      and observing that the wound needs treatment. Before he does so, he asks
      one question, and does not seem to like the answer, leaving Miguel to die,
      declaring his life not worth saving. Alfyn arrives, observing the scene
      unfold, and berates this other apothecary. The man digs into his stance
      that he has the right to choose his patients. He leaves, and Alfyn treats
      Miguel before heading to the tavern for a meal.

      On arriving, he finds a commotion: a woman shouts for help, her son
      collapsed on the floor. Alfyn struggles to come to a diagnosis, but the
      other apothecary arrives and promptly gives his diagnosis and a cure for
      the child's allergic paroxysm. He introduces himself as Ogen and departs
      once more. Alfyn admires the skill of his fellow practitioner, but remains
      bothered by his mysterious ethic.

      Around the town, Alfyn continues to help its people in what ways he can.
      While treating one older woman, he asks about wine from the town's famous
      grapes that he could share with Miguel. The woman seems shocked that the
      two are acquainted, revealing Miguel to be a thief and rumored murderer of
      ill repute in the town. Outside the house, Ogen meets Alfyn once more,
      telling him what he'd observed of Miguel - a false story, concealed
      dagger, and blood not his own. Sparks fly between the two as their ethics
      clash. Ogen observes the confident competence displayed by Alfyn's tonics,
      and earnestly warns him to let Miguel die.

      Alfyn returns to check up on Miguel, finding his wound worse than
      expected. He plans to treat Miguel with stronger medicine, but is reminded
      of Ogen's words, and confronts the man with the rumors. Miguel concedes he
      had done those deeds, but claims innocence by need: three starving
      children to feed at his home. Alfyn hears this, and agrees to continue
      treatment, on the condition that Miguel seek honest work. He works through
      the night to get him over the hump, then collapses into slumber. When he
      wakes, Miguel is gone.

      Alfyn searches for the wounded man, and finds him holding the same boy
      from earlier hostage, threatening to slit his throat unless his mother
      gives him all she has on her. When he sees Alfyn, he retreats into the
      Rivira Woods with the boy, maintaining his threat and demanding every leaf
      she can muster. Alfyn pursues, his wrath kindled, and seeks Miguel out. He
      finds him, deep in the woods, having stabbed Timothy when he wouldn't be
      quiet. He refuses to let Alfyn near to treat him, and states he doesn't
      want to risk Alfyn running off with Timothy when he has four people to
      feed at home. Alfyn catches the inconsistency in Miguel's story, and
      Miguel mocks the apothecary's gullibility. Alfyn determines to set right
      the mistake he made by curing Miguel, but Miguel warns him that he wasn't
      lying about the mercenary past of Miguel Twinspears. He manges to defeat
      the vagabond, and carries Timothy to safety.

      Alfyn leaves town a few days later. As he departs, Ogen passes him, and
      he asks what he could have done differently. Ogen observes he made a poor
      choice in treating Miguel, then goes on to tell him of a similar choice
      he'd made 10 years ago, when a wanted man he'd sheltered and healed had
      murdered his wife. He departs, and Alfyn finds he's no closer to having an
      answer, a guide to making the right decisions, choosing who to heal
      without risking the lives of others. With heavy heart, he makes his way
      towards Orewell.

      Olberic follows the trail told by Gustav to Wellspring, hoping to find
      Erhardt. The townspeople seem to admire him, as he has been using his
      blade in great service to the town, defending it from the encroaching
      lizardmen; however, none seem to know exactly where he is to be found.

      Olberic's questioning draws the attention of the town guard, who take him
      in for some questioning of their own. Olberic lays out the facts of who he
      and Erhardt are, but conceals his purpose in seeking Erhardt out. Yet the
      interview is cut short by one Captain Bale, who reveals that he had
      offered to take the wandering Erhardt in after his defense of an inbound
      caravan. Olberic wrestles with himself, trying to determine whether it is
      right to confront him and his new-found purpose. He finally settles on
      meeting him, hoping to rediscover purpose of his own in doing so.

      A horde of lizardmen assault the town at that very moment, interrupting
      Olberic's discovery; he takes up his blade to defend the town. Having
      driven them off, he chases after Erhardt in the nearby caverns. In its
      depths, he finds his quarry fending off a pack of lizardmen, and joins his
      defense, causing Erhardt to start in surprise; yet he agrees to the aid,
      and they wipe out the onslaught together, dispatching the leaders of the
      horde. In doing so, Olberic finally discovers his purpose, those he can
      defend: any who may need his wandering sword.

      The fight over, he returns to Erhardt, who confirms Gustav's tale; the
      former knight of Hornburg tells of the plot of vengeance he'd woven in the
      name of his family, and the emptiness its fulfillment had left in its
      wake. Furthermore, he realizes the treasure he'd given up in the
      companionship of his fellow soldiers. He regrets the lie he'd lived, yet
      Olberic has no choice but to draw his blade against him, despite Erhardt's
      warnings.

      Erhardt cedes the ensuing challenge with no regrets, granting Olberic the
      answer to a last question: Who led Erhardt's band to plot Hornburg's fall?
      His answer comes clear: Werner. Erhardt also grants Olberic his last known
      destination: Riverford.
      
      Olberic emerges from the cave, and shortly after him, Erhardt follows,
      alive and well. The knights of Wellspring thank Olberic for his aid, but
      he declines: his purpose was his own. Erhardt warns Olberic about the
      mysterious fear Werner wields behind his blade. The two part on good
      terms, hands clasped in hope to see each other again, and Olberic strikes
      out for Riverford to pursue his new cause: removing this fiend from the
      world before he can cause more destruction as he did with Hornburg.

      Therion seeks the emerald dragonstone in Wellspring's black market. A
      pinched bottle of wine opens the mouth of a suspect pauper, who Therion
      asks about the stone. The man sends him down a trail beginning with
      unlisted menu items at the local pub, and ending at a cave in the deserts
      south of town. Masked men guard the entrance, permitting other masked men
      to enter.

      Therion realizes he needs a mask to enter, but manages to think around the
      problem, stealing the market's inventory from the barkeep instead. He
      discovers the person bringing the stone - 'a man with a black hat' - and
      finds him at the entrance to the market. Just as he's planning to steal
      the stone, the man is accosted by bandits and cut down, taking the stone
      for themselves and racing into the cave.

      Therion tails them inside, and demands the stone, only to be approached by
      a red-haired man: Darius, his former partner. Darius quickly notices the
      fool's bangle, mocking Therion for it before sicing his own men at him
      (1 x [[Darius's Henchman][Darius's Henchman]], 2 x [[Darius's Lackey][Darius's Lackey]]). Therion deals with them,
      recalling how he'd used him in a similar way in their time together before
      cutting him down over a precipice in the Cliftlands, killing him to gain a
      high place among the Ciannos Therion had humiliated. Darius had gotten
      tired of Therion pushing against him, seeking to do things better.

      Therion shakes his memories, using a shortcut to intercept Darius at an
      exit to the cave. He probes Darius, but his former partner refuses to tell
      why he, too, is after the stone. Gareth, Darius' new right-hand man,
      offers to take on Therion while Darius makes good his escape.

      Therion exits the cave, having defeated Gareth, and returns to Cordelia
      empty-handed. Cordelia prods him about the loose ends he hints at, and
      emphasizes that like him, she has suffered betrayal, and understands his
      sadness and lack of trust. She speaks to him of the sycophants that had
      surrounded her after her parents' death. Heathcote steps in to observe
      that Darius' gang has the run of Northreach, and heads that direction to
      reconnoiter. Therion speaks briefly with Cordelia, asking why she still
      trusts; to this, she responds with Heathcote's own saying to her: 'Only
      the betrayed know the true meaning of trust.'

      Olberic seeks sign of the traitor Erhardt in Victor's Hollow, where the
      brigand Gaston had told him of Gustav, the Black Knight who might be able
      to point his steps in the right direction. Gustav seems to be a hot new
      contender in the city's famed arena.
      
      A woman named Cecily notices Olberic, and offers to sponsor him in the
      arena, hoping he's the key to her big break, noting that that's his best
      bet to talk to Gustav. She offers a way to get him in even after the
      qualifying rounds: publicly provoke and defeat one of the qualified
      fighters. He seeks out and challenges a Contemptuous and a Prideful
      Warrior, drawing out Victorino, the Buccaneer's Bane: bounty hound.
      Olberic handily beats Victorino, and he honorably offers his place in the
      tournament. The whole town is abuzz with news of the swordsman of the
      fallen realm. 

      Introductions made, the tournament begins, with Gustav hinting that he
      will tell Olberic more upon his victory. He duels Joshua Frostblade, who
      fights for love; Archibold the Crusher, who fights for his father's
      memory; and Gustav, the Black Knight. He realizes he fights today for
      victory alone this day; and with that reason, he defeats Gustav, and is
      crowned the new king of the arena. Yet he still lacks a reason to carry
      his blade.

      Back at his inn room, Gustav tells Olberic of Erhardt, the spy he had
      always been since his hometown had been sacked, and how he blamed King
      Alfred of Hornburg for not coming to its defense. Both Olberic and Gustav
      comment on how proud they were to know him, despite his deeds. Gustav
      points Olberic in the direction of Wellspring to find Erhardt at last.
      Olberic muses on the reason Erhardt wielded his blade: vengeance. He
      wonders if he set the sword aside, now his vengeance was complete.

      On his way out of town, Cecily catches up to him and offers to make him
      a full-time champion if he ever returns. Olberic declines; it is not the
      life for him, and the road beckons him on to the Sunlands.

***** DONE Tressa: Chapter 3                                         :Tressa:
      Tressa arrives in Victors Hollow, seeking a treasure worthy of the
      Merchant's Faire, following in the footsteps of the author of the book she
      carries. Walking among the stalls, she spots a map, and inquires about it
      with the dealer. Inspecting closer, she observes writing: "Here lies my
      most precious treasure. --Baltazar" The dealer recognizes the name as
      belonging to a dread pirate of the Eastern Seas, and snatches the map
      back, hoping to make a good profit off it - though he does give Tressa
      some compensation in a handful of candy.

      Tressa rests and reads the journal some more, its author stating that he
      seeks one treasure precious enough to cease his journies. As she muses,
      Captain Leon steps out of the tavern nearby and greets her. They catch up,
      but behind them, Mikk and Makk reappear, and nearly return to blows with
      Tressa before Leon stops them; it appears they have taken up new flags
      with the captain. They depart, and Leon tells her the reason for his
      presence in this town: he visits the home of an old friend on the
      anniversary of his passing, the pirate Baltazar. Tressa recognizes the
      name, and guides Leon to the map. The dealer recognizes Leon as well,
      marking him too as a former scourge of the seas.

      Leon examines the map, affirming its origin. The antique dealer sees his
      mark, and asks whether Leon knows of Edbart's Shield, a weapon of legend.
      He offers to trade it for the map if Leon can get his hands on it. Leon
      declines, and takes his leave. Tressa resolves to put the map in Leon's
      hands, though. She seeks out the shield and haggles for it, turning
      around to barter it for the map, and finally bringing the memento to Leon.
      She'd seen the forlorn look on seeing it, and on receiving it, he begins
      to reminisce.

      Baltazar, the Wild Eagle, and Leon, the Sea Serpent, clashing on the high
      seas. Growing up in the slums, scrabbling to reach the top. Baltazar at
      one time revealed to Leon his original dreams of becoming a merchant,
      bringing people together through trade, a dream he longed for even in his
      time as a pirate. In their last race, Baltazar coaxed Leon to wager that
      which he treasured most. Baltazar never made it through the storm, though
      his ship still won the race, wrecked on its shores. The map held the
      location of the gem Baltazar had wagered, 'eldrite', the Eye of the Sea -
      the only ore of its kind in the world. Tressa resolves to find this, too,
      for Leon's sake, and ventures into the Forgotten Grotto. In its depths, she
      finds the treasure right where it was marked - and a great beast that does
      not care for her presence.

      Tressa dispatches the beast, and opens the chest to find the beautiful
      Eldrite, along with a letter addressed to Leon. She returns them to Leon,
      and he reads the letter, where Baltazar asked whether Leon had found what
      was most precious to him. Leon recalls his friend's words, his search for
      treasure not giving the meaning he'd sought. In the time following his
      friend's death, he repaired the ship, took down his own flag, and pursued
      the life of a merchant in Baltazar's stead.

      Leon turns the stone over to Tressa, noting that the letter held more
      value to him than the stone, which he considers worthless. His prize of
      true value is Baltazar's ship, the emblem of his new life. He asks the same
      question of Tressa, but she doesn't yet know what her most precious
      treasure might be. They part ways, and Tressa heads for the Merchant's Fair
      with her prize: The eldrite will make a fine showing. Behind her, a hooded
      man follows.
