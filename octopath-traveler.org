      Primrose follows the map she'd taken from her former master, Helgenish. In
      a bid to get people talking, she takes the stage of the local pub. As she
      performs, she's found by Arianna, a servant of House Azelhart while
      Primrose was a girl. She appears to be hiding something of her occupation
      and her knowledge of what the map points to. She takes her to her home,
      in actuality a world-renowned brothel, Stillsnow's secret. She reveals the
      map as pointing to the drop-off point for the brothel's customers, and
      Primrose plans to take the carriage back to the man with the crow-marked
      arm. She finds the driver impassable, but a word to the barkeep he's
      indebted to ensures her passage.
      As she rides, she recalls memories of her father, raising her to become
      the next head of House Azelheart, gifting her with a dagger with the house
      words, "Faith shall be your shield," - a reminder to choose her beliefs
      and faith wisely. The carriage takes her to the
      [[Road to the Obsidian Parlor (20)][Road to the Obsidian Parlor (20)]], a hub of human trafficking, where she
      enters the house through a [[Secret Path (21)][Secret Path (21)]].
      As she does, we see Father Eschard - a Bishop of the Flame - begging the
      Left-hand man - Rufus -  to help him take revenge on a house that had
      violated his daughter and left her to commit suicide. Rufus agrees, and
      offers one of his girls - Arianna - to his service.
      Primrose confronts Rufus with her identity, and he tells her her father
      had made too many enemies, and learned the wrong kinds of things. She, in
      turn, tells him of the one thing she believes in: Revenge.
      She fells him where he stands, and in his dying words he points her to her
      next destination: back home, to Noblecourt. As she departs, Arianna
      prompts her to tell what she believes in, and to her sorrow, Primrose
      reaffirms her commitment to vengeance.
